    "\\textbf{Curse of dimensionality}\n\nAccording to Pedro Domingos: \"Intuition fails in high dimensions\". This is also known as the \\textit{curse of dimensionality} (Bellman, 1961).\n\n\\textbf{Claim 1:} \"Generalizing correctly becomes exponentially harder as the dimensionality grows because fixed-size training sets cover a dwindling fraction of the input space.\"\n\nTo see this, assume that our data is uniformly distributed in the box $[0,1]^d$. Take the point at the center of this box, i.e., the point $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, and draw a (small) box around it of side length $r$. What fraction of the total volume does this smaller box cover? It is $r^d$. Therefore, in expectation a fraction $r^d$ of the data lies in this small box. Let the desired fraction be 0.8. Then for $r = 0.01$ in 10 dimensions we need $r^d = 0.8$ and if we want to capture a fraction 0.8 of the data then we need $r = 0.8$ (recall the large box has a side length of only 1)! So we need to explore almost the whole range in each dimension!\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n    \\centering\n    \\begin{tabular}{cc}\n      \\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{curse_dimensionality_1.png} &\n      \\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{curse_dimensionality_2.png}\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\caption{ \\textbf{FIGURE 2.6.} The curse of dimensionality is well illustrated in this figure. In order to capture most of the dataset, especially when the data is high-dimensional, almost the whole range needs to be explored. The image on the left depicts a small box around the central point of a larger box. The image on the right shows how the fraction of data captured by the smaller box dramatically decreases as the dimensionality increases. For $d=2,3,4$ it is easy to visualize that this fraction $r^d$ drops exponentially, and even for higher dimensions, the plot indicates the same phenomenon.}\n\\end{figure}",
    "We will see shortly that as a result we have to scale the number of samples exponentially in the dimension if we want our risk to stay constant.\n\nClaim 2: In high-dimension, data-points are far from each other. Consequently, \"as the dimensionality increases, the choice of nearest neighbor becomes effectively random.\" Consider again \\(N\\) data points uniformly distributed in the box \\([0, 1]^d\\). We consider a nearest-neighbor estimate at the point \\(\\left\\{\\frac{1}{2}, \\cdots, \\frac{1}{2}\\right\\}\\). Assume that we center another unit-side box of side-length \\(r\\). How large do we have to pick \\(r\\) so that the chance that at least one point falls into this smaller box is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)?\n\nWe claim that\n\n\\[ r = \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{1/N}\\right)^{1/d} \\]\n\nFor \\(N = 500\\), \\(d = 10\\), this number is 0.52. So the box has to have a side length of half the one of the large box before we can hope to find a neighbor inside it.\n\nTo see this claim, what is the chance that a random sample inside the big box is not inside this small box? This probability is \\(1 - r^d\\), since the small box covers a fraction of \\(r^d\\) of the volume of the big box. Therefore, the chance that none of \\(N\\) i.i.d. samples fall inside the small box is equal to \\((1 - r^d)^N\\). We want this probability to be \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) (we are looking for the median). Solving for \\(r\\) confirms the above claim.",
    "\\textbf{Analysis of nearest neighbor rule}\n\nOur aim is to analyze the simplest setting. We consider the nearest neighbor classifier and we will compare its performance to the optimal (Bayes) classifier. This will confirm our intuition about the curse of dimensionality and tell us how good this classifier performs compared to the best we can hope for. In particular, if we have plenty of data we will see a simple and pleasing connection.\n\nHere is our set-up. We assume that $x$ takes values in $\\mathcal{X}=[0,1]^d$ and that $Y=\\{0,1\\}$ (binary classification). We assume further that there is some unknown distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ on $\\mathcal{X} \\times Y$ from which samples are drawn. Our training set $S_{train}$ will consist of $N$ i.i.d. samples. Associated to the distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ there is the conditional probability\n\n$$\nP(y=1 \\mid x).\n$$\n\nTo ease our notation, let us introduce\n\n$$\n\\eta(x) = P(y=1 \\mid x).\n$$\n\nIn words, $\\eta(x)$ is the conditional probability that the label is $1$ given that the input is $x$.\nIf we knew the distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ (and hence $\\eta(x)$) we would design the classifier $f$ which outputs\n\n$$\nf_{\\eta}(x)=1_{\\{\\eta(x)>1/2\\}}.\n$$\n\nThis is the Bayes classifier (also called maximum a posteriori or MAP classifier). It has the smallest probability of misclassification of any classifier, namely\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(f_{\\eta}) = \\mathbb{E}_{x} \\min \\{\\eta(x), 1-\\eta(x)\\}.\n$$",
    "It is instructive to compare the classification error of our\nnearest neighbor classifier to this optimal classifier.\nIt is clear that we cannot hope to perform well if there is\nno correlation between the \u201cposition\u201d x and the associated\nlabel. E.g., consider the case where the label y is chosen\nrandomly and independently from x. It is then of no help\nto know the labels of points close by. So we need to make a\nsuitable assumption regarding D. Here is one way of doing\nthis. We demand that the distribution $D$ is such that for\nsome constant $c$ we have\n\\[\n|\\eta(x) - \\eta(x')| \\leq c||x - x'||,\n\\]\nwhere on the right we have the Euclidean distance. In words,\nwe ask that the conditional probability $\\Pr\\{y = 1 | x\\}$ (seen\nas a function of $x$) is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz\nconstant $c$. This seems a reasonable assumption: if we move\na point only slightly, we want that the value of $\\eta$ does not\nchange too much. We associate every $x$ with a slightly\ndifferent label.\nLet $\\mathcal{L}_f$ denote the risk (classification error) for this setting\nassuming that we use the Bayes classifier and let $\\mathcal{L}_{f_{\\text{smain}}}$ denote\nthe risk (classification error) for this setting if we use\nthe nearest neighbor classifier.\n\n\\textbf{Lemma.}\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}_{f_{\\text{smain}}}[\\mathcal{L}_{f_{\\text{smain}}}] \\leq 2 \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{L}_f} + c \\mathbb{E}_{f_{\\text{smain}}}[||x - \\text{nbh}_{\\text{smain}}(x)||]\n\\leq 2 \\mathcal{L}_f + c \\mathbb{E} \\overline{V} \\text{dim}.\n\\]\n\nBefore we see where this bound comes from, let us interpret\nthis result. We see that the risk of the nearest neighbor\n",
    "classifier is upper bounded by twice the risk of the optimal \nclassifier plus a \u201cgeometric\u201d term. This term is the average \ndistance of a randomly chosen point to the nearest point in \nthe given training set times the Lipschitz constant c. \nIt is very natural to have this second term present. Our \nassumption was that nearby points are likely to have the \nsame label. So it is reasonable to expect in the bound a \nterm that depends on the average distance. \nSo let us discuss what happens in certain limiting cases. As- \nsume at first that we have a fixed dimension and that the \nsize of the training data tends to infinity. Then the second \nterm on the right will converge to zero and we see that in \nthis case we have a risk which is at most twice the Bayes \nrisk. So if we have plenty of data then we are doing well! \nOn the other hand, if we fix the size of the data, namely $N$, \nbut increase the dimension we see from the bound that very \nquickly we should expect a large error. The second term on \nthe right is proportional to $1/N$ to the power $1/d+1$ (there \nis an extra term $d^N$ in the bound but this is relatively \nminor and hence let us ignore it). More precisely, in order to \nkeep the second term on the right constant, let\u2019s say $\\alpha$, $\\alpha << 1$, \nwe need to let $N$ grow like $(1/ \\alpha)^{d+1}$, i.e., exponential in \nthe dimension. This is another way of seeing the curse of \ndimensionality. \nNote that the nearest neighbor rule is an interpolating clas- \nsification method (since the training labels are predicted at \nthe training points, it obtains zero classification error at the \ntraining data). Thus the previous result is going against \nthe common belief that interpolating classifiers are not gen-",
    "eralizing and will alway lead to overfitting. However this \nmethod is still not consistent (when the number of training \ndata is going to infinity, the difference between its classifica-\ntion error and the Bayes risk, i.e., the minimal risk possible,\nis not going to zero) and saturates at twice the Bayes risk.\nInterested readers can read the following paper of Belkin \n(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05161.pdf) where related classifi-\ncation rules are shown to be nearly consistent.\n\n\\textbf{Proof.} Let us now explain how to derive such a bound. We \nfollow the proof in Chapter 19 of the \u201cUnderstanding Ma-\nchine Learning\u201d book. You can find a more detailed expla-\nnation there. \nWe start with the second inequality. How do we bound \n$E_{\\text{S=train,x}\\sim p}[|K - nbhs_{\\text{train}}(x)|] \\text{ by } 4\\sqrt{N^*} +n$? Take the unit \ncube $[0,1]^d$. Recall that this is the space of inputs. Cut this \n\"large\" cube into small little cubes of side length \u03b5. Con-\nsider now what happens when we want to predict a label for\na \u201cfresh\u201d input.\nConsider the cube which contains x. If we are lucky, the same \ncube also contains elements from the training set $S_{\\text{train}}$\nIn this case x has a neighbor in $S_{\\text{train}}$ at distance at most \u03b5. Sincer\nthe neighbors for our estimation algorithm at short distance leads\nto good prediction (but if x lies next to at least one member),\nsmallKestfrom the training data, then the nearest neigh-\nborhood algorithm is correct and we are happy.\nSo what is the chance that a random test point x ends \nup in a specific box and this box does not have a training \npoint in there?",
    "If the probability of $x$ landing in a particular box $i$ is lets say $P_i$, then the chance that none of the $N$ training symbols are in box $i$ is $(1 - P_i)^N$. This is the main step in this proof. We do not know the distribution $D$ and hence cannot determine the probabilities $P_i$. But it turns out that this is not important. No matter how the probability is distributed over the boxes, we are fine. The reason is simple. If $P_i$ is large (i.e., this case happens often) we are fine since then it is very likely that we also have at least one training sample in this box. But if $P_i$ is small (and hence also the probability that we have a training point in there is small) then it is fine since by definition this does not happen very often.\n\nThe rest is calculus, carefully choosing the right scaling for $\\epsilon$ in order to get a good bound.\n\nIt still remains to explain the term $2L(f_i)$. Consider the following experiment. We are given two points $x$ and $x'$, both elements of $[0, 1]^d$. Assign to these two points labels $y$ and $y'$ according to the distribution $\\eta(x)$. What is the chance that these two labels are not the same? We claim that\n\\[\n\\Pr\\{ y \\neq y' \\} \\leq 2 \\eta(x)(1 - \\eta(x)) + c || x - x' ||.  \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nThis is easily explained. Assume at first that we draw the two labels $y$ and $y'$ independently but according to the same conditional probability $\\eta(x)$. In this case the probability that the two labels are different is exactly $2 \\eta(x)(1-\\eta(x))$. But according to our model we draw the label for $x$ according to the conditional probability $\\eta(x)$ and the label for $x'$ independently but according to the conditional probability $\\eta(x')$. These two quantities are in general not the same. But \n",
    "we have\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\eta(x)(1 - \\eta(x')) + \\eta(x')(1 - \\eta(x)) & \\\\\n= 2\\eta(x)(1 - \\eta(x)) + (\\eta(x) - 1)(\\eta(x) - \\eta(x')) & \\\\\n\\leq 2\\eta(x)(1 - \\eta(x)) + \\eta(x) - \\eta(x) \\eta(x') & \\\\\n\\leq 2\\eta(x)(1 - \\eta(x)) + c\\|x - x'\\|^2. & \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nConsider now the following experiment. Draw a set $S_{\\text{train}}$ according to the distribution $D$ but hide the labels $y_i$ and only reveal the inputs $\\mathbf{x}_i$. Then draw one more \u201cfresh\u201d sample $(x, y)$ but hide also in this case the label $y$ and only reveal $x$. Find the point in $S_{\\text{train}}$ that is closest to $x$, call it $x_{\\text{nbh} S_{\\text{train}}, k (x)}$. Now reveal the label $y$ associated to $x$ as well as the label $y_{\\text{nbh} S_{\\text{train}}, k (x)}$ associated to this closest point $x_{\\text{nbh} S_{\\text{train}}, k (x)}$. What is the probability that these two labels do not agree?\n\nThis is exactly the risk $E_{S_{\\text{train}}}[L(S_{\\text{train}}, x)]$. And according to (1) we can bound this probability by averaging the right hand side over all choices of $x$ and nbh $S_{\\text{train}}, k (x)$.

    "\\textbf{Motivation}\n\nAssume that your friend has trained a model on some data and now claims to have found the \"perfect\" regression function $f$. How can you verify this claim and have confidence that $f$ will have good performance? This leads us to the question of generalization and validation.\n\nAs a second motivation consider the following problem. We have seen in ridge regression that the regularization parameter $\\lambda > 0$ can be tuned to reduce overfitting by reducing model complexity,\n\n\\[\n\\min_w \\frac{1}{2N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} (y_n - \\mathbf{x}_n^T \\mathbf{w})^2 + \\lambda \\| \\mathbf{w} \\|^2\n\\]\n\nThe parameter $\\lambda$ is a hyper-parameter. \n\nIn a similar manner, we can enrich the model complexity, by augmenting the feature vector $\\mathbf{x}$. E.g., consider a polynomial feature expansion. Here the degree $d$ is a hyperparameter. \n\nTo see a final example consider neural nets. Here we have tens or hundreds of hyperparameters: architecture, width, depth, type of the network etc.\n\nIn all these cases we are faced with the same problem: how do we choose these hyperparameters? This is \\textit{the model selection problem}.",
    "\\textbf{Data Model and Learning Algorithm}\n\nIn order to give a meaningful answer to the above questions we first need to specify our data model.\n\nWe assume that there is an (unknown) underlying distribution $\\mathcal{D}$, with range $X \\times Y$.

Often this is done by optimising a cost function. We have seen that we can use e.g. (stochastic) gradient descent or least-squares for the ridge-regression model as an efficient way of implementing this learning. Write $f_S = A(S)$, where $A$ denotes the learning algorithm.\n\nIf we want to indicate that $f_S$ also depends on parameters of the model, e.g., the $\\lambda$ in the ridge regression model, we can add a subscript to write $f_{S, \\lambda}$.\n\n\\vspace{0.2cm}\n\\textbf{True Error, Empirical Error, and Training Error}\n\nGiven a model $f$, how can we assess if $f$ is any good? We should compute the \\textit{expected error} over all samples chosen according to $\\mathcal{D}$, i.e., we should compute\n\n\\[ L_\\mathcal{D}(f) = \\mathbb{E}_{D}[\\ell(y, f(x))], \\]\n\nwhere $\\ell(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is our loss function.

It is therefore natural to compute the equivalent \\textit{empirical} quantity\n\\[\nL_{S}(f) = \\frac{1}{|S|} \\sum_{(x_{n},y_{n})\\in S} \\ell (y_{n}, f(x_{n})). \\tag{1}\n\\]\nThis is called the \\textit{(empirical) (risk/loss/error)}. There is one added complication. Assume that we are given the data $S$. If we first learn the model from $S$, i.e., we compute $f_{S} = A(S)$ and then we compute the empirical risk of $f_{S}$ using the same data $S$ then in fact we are computing\n\\[\nL_{S}(f_{S}) = \\frac{1}{|S|} \\sum_{(x_{n}, y_{n})\\in S} \\ell (y_{n}, f_{S}(x_{n})).\n\\]\nThis is called the \\textit{training (risk/loss/error)} and we have already discussed in previous lectures that this training error might not be representative of the error we see on \"fresh\" samples.\nThe reason that $L_{S}(f_{S})$ might not be close to $L_{\\mathcal{D}}(f_{S})$ is of course overfitting.\nSo let us summarize. If somebody hands us a function $f$ then there is the true risk $L_{\\mathcal{D}}(f)$ associated to $f$, but we cannot obtain it in general. If we have some data $S$ that was not used in obtaining $f$, then we can compute the empirical risk of $f$ with respect to $S$. This is denoted by $L_{S}(f)$. We will shortly distinguish between the data used to fit the functions. And if $S$ was used to learn $f$, then we denote it by $f_{S}$ and call the resulting empirical error the training error, $L_{S}(f_{S})$.",
    "\\textbf{Splitting the Data and Test Error}\n\nBefore we go on and explore the relationship between the true risk and the empirical risk, let us first see how we can address the potential overfitting problem that occurs if we train and test the model on the same data. \\\\\n\\textbf{Problem:} Validating model on the same data subset we trained it on! \\\\\n\\textbf{Fix:} Split the data into a \\textbf{training} and a \\textbf{test set} (a.k.a. validation set), call them $S_{\\text{train}}$ and $S_{\\text{test}}$, respectively. We apply the learning algorithm $A$ to the training set $S_{\\text{train}}$ and compute the function $f_{S_{\\text{train}}}$. We then compute the error on the test set, i.e.,\n$$\nL_{\\text{S}_{\\text{test}}}(f_{S_{\\text{train}}}) = \\frac{1}{|S_{\\text{test}}|} \\sum_{(x_i,y_i) \\in S_{\\text{test}}} \\ell(y_i, f_{S_{\\text{train}}}(x_i)).\n$$\nThis is called the \\textbf{(test/validation) (risk/loss/error)}. Since $S_{\\text{test}}$ is a \"fresh\" sample we can hope that $L_{S_{\\text{test}}}(f_{S_{\\text{train}}})$ is close to the quantity $L_{\\mathbb{P}}(f_{S_{\\text{train}}})$. \\\\\nBut: We payed a price. We had to split the data and now we have less data for both the learning as well as the validation/test. \\\\\n*Cross validation* as described below is more efficient in using data, but hard to analyze.\n\n\\textbf{True Error, Test Error, and Generalization Error}\n\nWe now get back to our original question. Assume that we have a model $f$, and that our loss function $\\ell(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is bounded,",
    "let's say in $[a, b]$. We are given a test set $S_{\\text{test}}$ chosen i.i.d. from the underlying distribution $D$ (and this test set was not used to train the model). The test/empirical error is\n\\[\nL_{S_{\\text{test}}}(f) = \\frac{1}{|S_{\\text{test}}|} \\sum_{(x_i,y_i) \\in S_{\\text{test}}} l(y_i, f(x_i)).\n\\]\n\nThe true error is\n\\[\nL_D(f) = E_{(x,y) \\sim D}[l(y, f(x))].\n\\]\n\nHow far are these apart? This is called the generalization error and it is given by\n\\[\n|L_D(f) - L_{S_{\\text{test}}}(f)|.\n\\]\n\nFirst note that in expectation they are the same, i.e.,\n\\[\nL_D(f) = E_{S_{\\text{test}}}[L_{S_{\\text{test}}}(f)]. \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\nwhere the expectation is over the samples of the test set. But we need to worry about the tail. We claim that\n\\[\n\\Pr \\left[ |L_D(f) - L_{S_{\\text{test}}}(f)| \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{(b-a)^2 \\ln(2/\\delta)}{2|S_{\\text{test}}|}} \\right] \\leq \\delta. \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\n\\textit{Insights:} The error decreases as $O(1/\\sqrt{|S_{\\text{test}}|})$ with the number test points. The more data points we have therefore, the more confident we can be that the empirical loss we measure is close to the true error. Thus if we want $\\delta$ to be small we only need to increase the size of the test set slightly.\n\n\\textit{Proof of} (3):",
    "Since we assumed that each data sample $(x_n, y_n)$ in the\ntest set $S_{test}$ is chosen independently, the associated losses\n$\\{y_{ln}, f(x_n)\\}$, given a fixed model $f$, are also i.i.d. random\nvariables, taking values in $[a, b]$ by assumption. Call each\nsuch loss $\\Theta_n$. The expected value of $\\Theta_n = (y_{ln}, f(x_n))$\nis equal to the true loss\n\n$$L_D(f) = \\mathbb{E}[(y_{ln}, f(x_n))].$$\n\nThe empirical loss on the other hand is equal to the average\nof $|S_{test}|$ such i.i.d. values.\nWe want to know the chance that the empirical loss $L_{S_{test}}(f)$\ndeviates from its true value by more than a given constant $\\eta$.\nThis is a classical problem addressed in the following lemma.\n\n\\textbf{Lemma 0.1} (Hoeffding's inequality). Let $\\Theta_1, \\ldots, \\Theta_N$ be a\nsequence of i.i.d. random variables with mean $\\mathbb{E}[\\Theta]$ and\nrange $[a, b]$. Then, for any $t > 0,$\n\n$$\\mathbb{P} \\left[ \\left| \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\Theta_n - \\mathbb{E}[\\Theta] \\right| \\geq  \\eta  \\right] \\leq 2e^{-2N\\eta^2 / (b-a)^2 }$$\n\nUsing Lemma 0.1 let us show (3). Equating $2e^{-2|S_{test}| \\eta^2 / (b-a)^2}$ \nwith $\\delta$ we get that $\\eta = \\sqrt{\\frac{(b-a)^2\\ln(2/\\delta)}{2|S_{test}|}}$\nas claimed.\n\n\\textbf{How to Use This Bound}\n\nLet us summarize. Assume at first that somebody hands you\na function $f$ and you have a data set $S$. Then you can assert",
    "that\n\\[\n\\mathbb{P} \\left[ L_D(f) > L_S(f) + \\frac{ \\left(b - a\\right)^2 \\ln \\left(\\frac{2}{\\delta} \\right) }{2 \\left| S \\right|} \\right] \\leq \\delta.\n\\]\n\nIn words, we can compute a probabilistic upper bound on the true risk since both $L_S(S)$ as well as the error term can be computed with the data at hand. \nIn the more general case, we are given a data set $S$ and we want to first learn a function and then compute an upper bound on the true risk of the learned function. In this case we should split $S$ into $S = S_{\\text{train}} \\cup S_{\\text{test}}$. We then let $f_{S_{\\text{train}}} = \\mathcal{A}(S_{\\text{train}})$. Then we can assert that:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbb{P} \\left[ L_D(f_{S_{\\text{train}}}) > L_{S_{\\text{test}}} (f_{S_{\\text{train}}}) + \\frac{(b-a)^2 \\ln (2/\\delta)}{2 \\left| S_{\\text{test}} \\right| } \\right] \\le \\delta.\n\\]\n\nSo also in this case do we get a computable probabilistic upper bound. In the second case we pay a price for splitting the data and the bound will in general be less tight.\n\n\\textbf{Model selection}\n\nLet us now get to our second, related, problem. We are looking for a way to select the hyperparameters of our model, like the parameter $\\lambda$ for the ridge regression problem. We say that we have a data set again $\\{S\\}$ and split this into $S_{\\text{train}}$ and $S_{\\text{test}}$ and we think of them as having been generated independently from the underlying distribution $D$. We have an indication that every possible value for hyperparameter $\\lambda$ in a parameter of the model, e.g., the parameter $\\lambda$ in the ridge",
    "regression problem. Let these values be $\\lambda_k, k = 1, \\ldots, K$. To keep things simple we assume that $K$ is some finite value. We run the learning algorithm K times on the same training set $S_{\\text{train}}$ to compute the K prediction functions $\\hat {f}_{\\text{train}, \\lambda_k}$. For each such prediction function we compute the test error $L_{\\text{test}} (\\hat {f}_{\\text{train}, \\lambda_k})$. We then choose that value of the parameter $\\lambda$ which gives us the smallest such test error.\n\nIn the figure below, we plot the test error (red) as well as the training error (blue) for many values of $\\lambda$ (grid search).\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{figure1.png}\n\\caption{Cross-validation}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe same procedure can be applied to select other model hyperparameters, such as the degree in case of a polynomial feature expansion.\n\n\\textbf{Model Selection Based on Test Error}\n\nIf for all models $\\hat {f}_{\\text{train}, \\lambda_k}$ the test error was exactly equal to the true error then it makes sense that we pick the best of these models. But we have seen that even if we compare the",
    "test to the true error of a single function in general there\nis a difference (the generalization error). And in the model\nselection problem we use the same test set $K$ times to com-\npute the test error for each of the $K$ models. How confident\ncan we be that the suggested procedure gives us meaningful\nresults? This is a slight extension of our previous analysis.\nAssume hence that we have $K$ models $K$ given on candidates\n$ k=1,\\ldots,K $. Again assume that our loss function $ l(\\cdot;\\cdot) $\nis bounded in $ [a,b] $. Given a test set $\\mathcal{S}_{test}$ chosen i.i.d. from \n$\\mathcal{D}$, what is the maximum generalization error, i.e. what is\nthe maximum difference between the true error and the test\nerror?\n\nSimilarly as in the case of a single model (3), we claim that we\ncan now bound the maximum deviation for all $K$ candidates,\nby\n\\[\n\\mathbb{P} \\left[ \\max_k \\vert L_\\mathcal{D} (f_k) - L_{S_{test}} (f_k) \\vert \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{ (b - a)^2 \\ln (2K / \\delta) } {2 \\lvert S_{test} \\rvert }} \\right] \\leq \\delta.\n\\]\n\n(4)\n\nInsights: The error decreases as $\\mathcal{O}(1 / \\sqrt{\\lvert S_{test} \\rvert})$ with the\nnumber test points. Now that we test $K$ hyper-parameters,\nour error only goes up by a very small factor which is propor-\ntional to $\\sqrt{\\ln (K)}$. So we can test many different models \nwithout incurring a large penalty.\n\nThe proof of this statement follows (3), which has answered\nthe special case of $K=1$.\n\nFor a general $K$, if we check the deviations for $K$ models\nand ask for the probability that for at least one such model \n",
    "we get a deviation of at least $\\epsilon$ then by the union bound this probability is at most $K$ times as large as in the case where we are only concerned with a single instance. I.e., the upper bound becomes $2Ke^{-2\\#S_{test}\\epsilon^{2}/(b - a)^{2}}$.\nHence, equating now $2Ke^{-2\\#S_{test}\\epsilon^{2}/(b - a)^{2}}$ with $\\delta$ we get that $\\epsilon = \\sqrt{\\frac{(b - a)^{2}\\ln(2K/\\delta)}{2\\#S_{test}}}$ as stated.\nLet\n\\[\nk^{*} = \\argmin_{k}L_D(f_k).\n\\]\nIn words, $f_{k^{*}}$ is that function that has the smallest true risk. Further, let\n\\[\nk = \\argmin_{k}L_{S_{test}}(f_k).\n\\]\nIn words, $f_{k}$ is that function that has the smallest empirical risk. Then a little thought shows that\n\\[\nP\\left[L_D(f_k) > L_D(f_{k^{*}}) + 2\\sqrt{\\frac{(b - a)^{2}\\ln(2K / \\delta)}{2\\#S_{test}}}\\right] \\le \\delta. \\tag{5}\n\\]\nIn words, if we choose the \u201cbest\u201d function according to the empirical risk then its true risk is not too far away from the true risk of the optimal choice.\n\n\\textbf{Extension to Infinitely Many Model Choices}\n\nThe basic idea of this bound can be carried over to the case where we have infinitely many models. In this case a more sophisticated concept, called the VC-dimension, is used: as long as we have models with a finite VC-dimension then the bound can be shown in the same form, with $K$ replaced by the VC dimension.",

The key to improving such schemes is to add well chosen features to the original data vector. E.g., assume that our data is two-dimensional, where all data with label $y = 0$ lies inside the unit circle and all data with label $y = 1$ lies outside the unit circle. A linear scheme, limited to the original input, cannot classify this data well. But if we add the features $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ and then continue to the input then the linear classification becomes trivial.\n\nIn \"real\" applications we are faced with the problem that we do not know a priori what features are useful. One option is to add as many features as possible. E.g., we could use all polynomnials of $x$ up to some order to our feature vector. But this quickly becomes computationally infeasible and can also lead to over-fitting.\n\nOne way to address the computational issue is to use the \"kernel trick.\" Alternatively, we can automatically learn the features that have been designed by a domain experts.\n\nBut at some higher level what we are doing is the same. Doing the same thing as we learn the weights of the linear classifier? This is what neural networks allow us to do.",
    "There is currently a lot of excitement about neural networks and its many applications. At the end of this short tutorial you will unlikely be able to program a neural net to play Go like a grandmaster. Many small tricks and lots of patience and computing power are needed to train neural nets for complicated tasks. But you will be able to write small scripts to solve standard handwriting recognition challenges. We will focus on basic questions.\nWe highly recommend the web tutorial by Michael Nielsen, neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com and we will follow it in many aspects.\n\n\\textbf{The Basic Structure}\n\nLet us look at the structure of a neural network. It is shown in Figure 1. This is a neural net with one input layer of size $D$, $L$ hidden layers of size $K$, and one output layer. It is a \\textit{feedforward} network: the computation performed by the network starts with the input from the left and flows to the right. There is no feedback loop.\nAs always, we assume that our input is a $D$-dimensional vector $\\mathbf{x}$. We see that there is a node drawn in Figure 1 for each of the $D$ components of $\\mathbf{x}$. We denote these nodes by $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_D$ where the superscript $(0)$ specifies that these are input \\textit{layer}.\nThe same network can be used for regression as well as classification. The only difference will be in the output layer. Let us discuss regression in a moment, but let us start there for now. We have already described the input layer. Let us now look at the hidden layers. Let us assume that there are",

There is no reason that all hidden layers should have the same size but we will stick to this simple model. How many layers are there typically? Not long ago, typical networks might have just had one or a few hidden layers. Modern applications have \u201cdeep\u201d nets with sometimes hundreds of layers. Training such deep nets poses new and challenging problems and we will have more to say about this later.\n\nEach node in the hidden layer $l$, $l = 1, \\ldots, L$, is connected to all the nodes in the previous layer via a weighted edge. We denote the edge from node $i$ in layer $l - 1$ to the node $j$ in layer $l$ by $w_{ij}^{[l]}$. The super-script $[l]$ indicates that these are the weights of edges that lead to layer $l$.",
    "The output at the node $j$ in layer $l$ is denoted by $x_{j}^{(l)}$ and it is given by\n\n\\[ x_{j}^{(l)} = \\phi \\left( \\sum_{i} w_{ji}^{(l)} x_{i}^{(l-1)} + b_{j}^{(l)} \\right). \\]\n\nIn words, in order to compute the output we first compute the weighted sum of the inputs and then apply a function $\\phi$ to this sum.\n\nA few remarks are in order. The constant term $b_{j}^{(l)}$ is called the bias term and is a parameter like any of the weights $w_{ji}^{(l)}$. The learning part will consist of choosing all these parameters appropriately for the task. The function $\\phi (\\cdot)$ is called the activation function. Many possibilities exist for choosing this function and we will explore some choices later on. For now, let us just mention one of the most popular one, namely the sigmoid function $\\phi (z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$. We have encountered this function already. It is the same as the logistic function. For future reference, Figure 2 shows a plot of this function. Note that the function is increasing from 0 to 1 and that for very small (negative) and very large (positive) values of the argument the function levels off. As we will discuss, this will cause troubles when training the network.\n\nA second point is that the function is non-linear. Why this is? Assume instead that the whole neural-net would just be a highly factorized linear function then there would be no benefit to using it as compare to standard linear regression/classification.\n\nAlthough for biological neurons the activation function choice is important for different nodes, it is common to choose the same function within the network.",
    "\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics{sigmoid_function.png}\n    \\caption{The sigmoid function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$}\n\\end{figure}\n\nTo connect back to our previous discussion we can decompose the neural network into two parts. The first part comprises the input layer and all the $L$ hidden layers. The task of this part of the net is to transform the original input into a more suitable representation. In other words, this part of the net represents a \\textit{function} from $\\mathbb{R}^D$ to $\\mathbb{R}^K$. It performs the task that typically was done by domain experts, namely finding suitable features of the input. We will soon discuss what functions such a network can implement. We will see that this simple structure can approximate any continuous function arbitrarily closely provided only that we allow $K$ to be sufficiently large.\n\nNow that we have (hopefully) a suitable representation of the data, the final layer performs the desired ML task. This means that it is either our trusted linear regressor or perhaps a linear classifier. Presumably at this point the regression/classification task is easy. So a simple linear regres-",

So we would not be surprised to see NNs struggle in such cases. But typically this is where they shine, having a performance on par or perhaps even surpassing humans. But to date, NNs (or other classifiers for that matter) are not as \\textit{robust} in their decisions as humans and can be easily tricked by adversarially chosen perturbations of the input, even if the perturbations are small. This can lead to problems.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{dog_or_mop.jpg}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\textit{Figure 1: Dog or mop?}\n\nIn the sequel it might be good to have a concrete example in mind. E.g., think of self-driving cars. And we will assume that we are using NNs. But the basic principle applies to a much wider setting.\n\nSo consider a self-driving car. Such a device hopefully will be able to recognize and correctly interpret street signs with very high probability. If the ML algorithm that performs",
    "this task can be easily tricked by slightly manipulating the\ninput then insurance companies might not be happy!!\n\n\\textbf{The Basic Attack using Back Propagation}\n\nSo let us look at the simplest instance. Assume that we \nhave trained a binary classifier \n$$f : X \\rightarrow \\{ \\pm 1 \\}$$\ngiven some training set \n$$S = \\{(x_n, y_n) \\}_{n=1}^N.$$ \nThere is an underlying data distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ that is unknown to us. Assume that we have trained the network well and that it has a small true risk, i.e.,\n$$\\mathcal{L}(f) = \\mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \\sim \\mathcal{D}}[1 \\{f(x) \\neq y \\}] \\leq \\delta,$$\nwhere $\\delta > 0$ is a small number. We are happy.\n\nBut assume now that an adversary were allowed to manipulate, i.e., change, the input $x$ slightly. How much worse can the risk be made? If we put no restriction on the \u201cpower\u201d of the adversary then clearly she can increase the risk at will. \nSo let us say that the adversary can change the given input $x$ to $\\tilde{x}$, but that we require that \n$$\\|\\tilde{x} - x\\|\\leq \\epsilon$$ \nfor some small \n$$\\epsilon > 0.$$ \nWhat norm shall we pick? [This  depends on the\n``Just to clear up any confusion: There are also GANs** whose coding/theory\nis stands for Generative Adversarial Networks. These might be confused with\nthe notion of the adversarial attack also referred to as \u201cadversarial sam-\nples\u201d. The GANs in this situation are used to upscale the adversarial attack\nto be able to train on more meaningful attack scenarios.]\nstructure of our input space and how we measure the size of the change. For images, the natural choice is the $l^p$ norm for some $p$ such as $p = 2$ or $p = \\infty$. For any choice of norm, our problem now becomes: Find an input $\\tilde{x}$ such that $\\|\\tilde{x} - x\\| \\leq \\epsilon$ and $f(\\tilde{x}) \\neq y$. In other words, find an $\\epsilon$-perturbation of a correctly classified\nimage that now gets misclassified. Given an appropriate approach, this could either be solved by better optimization strategies.]",
    "application and it is part of what is called the threat model. We will get back to this point later. It is customary in the literature to pick either $\\ell_1$, $\\ell_2$, or $\\ell_\\infty$. We can now define the adversarial risk, call it $\\mathcal{R}(f, \\epsilon)$, as\n\\[\n\\mathcal{R}(f, \\epsilon) = \\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\\sim\\mathcal{D}} \\left[ \\max_{\\|x'-x\\|\\leq\\epsilon} \\mathbb{I}\\{f(x')\\neq y\\} \\right].\n\\]\nIn words, for every input $x$ the adversary can find the worst perturbation allowed by the norm constraint. Depending on whether you are interested in \u201cbreaking\u201d the classifier or try to make it robust we are faced with numerous questions. Here are some in no particular order.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item How do we find adversarial perturbations efficiently?\n\\item In order to find those perturbations, what access to the classifier do we need?\n\\item By how much worse can we make the risk?\n\\item Are there measures we can take to make a given classifier more robust?\n\\item Are there particular ways to train the classifier to make it robust?\n\\end{enumerate}\nWe will explore some of these questions in the following sections.\n\n\\textbf{White Box Attacks}\n\nSo assume that we are given a binary classifier $f$.

You will explore this in the exercise session. Here is a the basic idea.\nIf it does not classify $\\mathbf{x}$ correctly then we are done -- we can just set $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{x}$. So we might as well assume that it does indeed classify $\\mathbf{x}$ correctly. To be specific, assume that the data is separable in principle, i.e., that there exists a \"ground truth\" encoded by the function $h : \\mathscr{X} \\rightarrow \\{ \\pm 1 \\}$. In other words, the correct label is non-probabilistic and is given by $h(\\mathbf{x}).$ Further assume that $f(\\mathbf{x})$ has the form\n\n\\[ \nf(\\mathbf{x}) = \n\\begin{cases} \n1, & 0 \\leq \\frac{1}{2} \\leq g(\\mathbf{x}) \\leq 1,\\\\ \n-1, & 0 \\leq g(\\mathbf{x}) < \\frac{1}{2} \n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nwhere $g : \\mathscr{X} \\rightarrow [0,1]$ represents the probability that $y = 1$ given the input, $\\mathbf{x}$.  Ie., we assume that, like in logistic regression, we first compute a probability and then we quantize. Of course $g$ depends on all the weights and the input values within the NN but we omit this dependence in our notation here since in the present context we are interested in changes in the input $\\mathbf{x}$ rather than changes in the parameters. \n\nWhy do we assume that $f$ has this form? We will see its application next in order to find adversarial perturbations. For now let us compute what the gradient of $f$ with respect to $\\mathbf{x}$. We will therefore write $g$ rather than the original $f$. Using the backpropagation algorithm we can efficiently compute $\\bigtriangledown_{\\mathbf{x}} g(\\mathbf{x}).$ Note that this is the gradient with respect to changes in the input rather than changes in the parameters.",
    "Hence\n\n\\[h(x)\\nabla_x g(x)\\]\n\nis a vector of length \\(D\\) (the dimension of the input space) which is positive in positions where an increase in that input makes the prediction more correct (increases the probability of the correct label) and negative where an increase in that dimension makes the prediction less correct.\n\nAssume that we are allowed to move the point \\(x\\) to a new point \\(\\tilde{x}\\), with the restriction that \\(\\|x - \\tilde{x}\\|_2 \\le \\epsilon\\). Note that we have assumed an \\(\\ell_2\\) constraint. Our aim is to make the prediction as bad as possible. This means that we would like to decrease the probability of the correct label as much as possible.\n\nIf \\(\\epsilon\\) is small then it makes sense to assume that the change in the probability is given by the first order change, i.e., that it is well predicted by the gradient. Given our ''budget'' in terms of \\(\\ell_2\\) the optimum move is then to move in the opposite direction of the gradient, i.e., to define\n\n\\[\\tilde{x} = x - \\epsilon h(x) \\frac{\\nabla_x g(x)}{\\|\\nabla_x g(x)\\|_2}\\]\n\nIf, for a particular \\(\\tilde{x}\\) we manage to ''flip'' the probability using a move that is bounded by \\(\\epsilon\\) then we have found an adversarial example. In general, we might not want to take a single step but rather only move partially in this direction and then iterate this process.\n\n*Mathematically the reasoning corresponds to the following. We are given a fixed vector \\(\\nabla f\\) of unit norm (in this case \\(\\nabla g\\)). Then the inner product \\(v^\\top \\nabla f\\) is maximized by \\(v=\\nabla f\\) and minimized by \\(v=-\\nabla f\\). This can be seen e.g. by the Cauchy Schwartz inequality: \\(v^\\top \\nabla f \\le \\|v\\| \\|\\nabla f \\|\\).*",
    "The above attack is known as a \u201cwhite box\u201d attack \u2013 we have access to the details of the algorithm.  \nHere is a good problem to think about. Assume that we are given as above the gradient $\\nabla_x g(x)$. What is the locally optimal move if our constraint is $\\| x - x ||_1 \\le \\epsilon$ or $\\| x - x \\|_{\\infty} \\le \\epsilon$ instead of the $\\ell_2$ constraint we used above?\n\n\\textbf{Black Box Attacks}\n\nIn the above attack we needed access to the NN that implemented the prediction in order to compute the gradients. In general it is a good idea in anything involving security to assume that the adversary has this level of access. Assume e.g.: autonomous cars. Typically those are sold in large quantities and it will not be difficult for an adversary to get a hold of one of those boxes.  \nBut even if we limit the adversary it turns out that similar attacks can still be carried out. Those are typically known as \u201cblack box\u201d attacks. In such attacks we assume that the adversary can observe the input output relationship but has no further access to the model.  \nThe key idea in the development of adversarial machine learning has been shown that adversarial attacks could be carried out by representing access to the algorithm or by black box access to matching the gradients (e.g., by adding some small amount of noise to the true inputs to the inputs, and then observing the changes to the output). But it has been shown that all such approaches can be easily broken and black box attacks can be exposed.  \nIn the simplest case assume the previous setting and assume",
    "further that we have access to the \"unquantized\" output\n$g(x)$. Assume that we want to compute the derivative with\nrespect to the $i$-th input component. We can do this numer-\nically by asking for the input output pairs for both $x$ and $x$\nwhich is equal to $x$, except in the $i$-th component, where it\nis slightly perturbed.\nBut what can we do if we only see the quantized output,\ni.e., the decision. In this case we cannot compute the deriva-\ntive. An ingenious approach for this case is as follows.\nGiven black box access to $f$ create a new set of samples\n$S = \\{(x,f(x))\\}$ by computing many input-output pairs.\nGiven $S$ train a new NN. This new NN does not have to\nhave the same structure (depth, width, activation functions\netc) as the original one. Now run a white box attack on\nthe newly-trained NN. Those adversarial differences that are\nfound in this way often also cause trouble for the original\nnetwork. If we assume that we have a sufficiently large num-\nber of examples so that we can learn $f$ perfectly then this is\nperhaps not surprising. But this approach seems to work\nalso in cases where the number of samples we have at our\ndisposal is quite reasonable.\n\n\\textbf{Adversarial Attacks on Physical Objects}\n\nSo far in our discussion we have assumed that we are given\nan input x and that we are finding an adversarial perturba-\ntion. But there exist much more interesting and potentially\nmore dangerous attacks. Consider the example of the vision\nof a self-driving car. The car presumably has a camera (or\nmultiple cameras). Assume that the car approaches an in-",
    "tersection and sees a traffic sign. Perhaps this traffic sign \nis a stop sign. How can the adversary perturb the input. \nPerhaps the adversary can \"hack\" the car itself. But a much \nsimpler attack is to perturb the actual physical stop sign. Is \nit possible to change the stop sign slightly so that a human \nwill still recognize it as a stop sign but that the car will likely \nmistake it for a different sign? Note that this is quite more \ncomplicated than our original set-up. We are not given a \nparticular input x but a whole family of stop signs. This \nfamily comes about since the car might approach the same \nstop sign from various slightly different angles, distances, and \nunder slightly different ambient lighting conditions. And we \nwould like the same attack (the same physical modification \nof the stop sign) to work under a broad set of those condi\u0002tions. Even in this case it has been shown that adversarial \nchanges can be found! This is quite non-trivial! Figure 2 \nshows what a perturbed stop sign might look like. Note that \nfor a human the change is visible but it is unlikely that it \nwill cause confusion.\n \n\\textbf{Why Some ML Algorithms Might Not Be Robust \u2014 Non-Robust Features}\n \nThe following example illustrates one reason why a ML algo\u0002rithm might learn a classification rule that has low standard \nrisk but high adversarial risk. \nThis is a toy example, but the basic idea is sound: the ML \nalgorithm might end of a large set of \"non-robust\" features \nthat can be easily tricked by perturbations.",
    "\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{stop_sign}\n\\caption{To stop or not to stop.}\n\\end{figure}\n\nConsider a binary classification task. We have $y \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}$. Let $\\mathbf{x}$ be the input vector. Assume that after applying a suitable transform we get the new input vector $\\mathbf{x}$ that has the following simple structure.\nWe have $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, \\ldots , x_D)$, where $x_i = a_iy + Z_i ,~ i = 1, \\ldots , D$, where $Z_i$ is Gaussian zero-mean and unit-variance noise which is independent for each component. Further, $a_1 = 1$ and for $i = 2, \\ldots , D$, we have $a_i = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\log(D)}{D-1}}$. The exact values for $a_i$ are not so important and are chosen simply for convenience. What is important is that the first component has a strong signal component, whereas the other features have a very weak such component. Strong versus weak is with respect to the strength of the noise that is added (zero-mean Gaussian of unit variance). We will say that the first feature is robust whereas the other features are not robust.\nTo summarize, each of the $D$ components is a scaled and",
    "noisy version of the label and all components represent conditionally independent observations. Further, the first component contains a strong signal component. The remaining $D - 1$ features contain extremely weak signal components but there are many of them (we assume that $D$ is large). Finally, assume that we are given the prior on the label $p(y)$ and that it is uniform.\n\nAssume at first that we are interested in the best classifier without adversarial perturbations, i.e., the classifier with the smallest possible risk (error probability). This is the Bayes classifier, i.e., we should compute the posterior probability and then choose that label that maximizes the posterior:\n$$\n\\arg\\max_{y \\in \\{ \\pm 1 \\}} p(y \\mid \\mathbf{x}) = \\arg\\max_{y \\in \\{ \\pm 1 \\}} \\frac{p(\\mathbf{x} \\mid y) p(y)}{p(\\mathbf{x})}\n$$\n$$\n= \\arg\\max_{y \\in \\{ \\pm 1 \\}} \\prod_{i=1}^{d} p(x_{i} \\mid y).\n$$\n\nIn the last step we have used the fact that under our model the observations are conditionally independent so that we get a product of the probabilities and that we have a uniform",

Therefore, the expression that we maximize over $\\mathbf{y}$ above is equal to\n\\[\n\\mathbf{y} y \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^D a_i^2 \\right) + \\mathbf{y} \\sum_{i=1}^D a_i Z_i = \\mathbf{y} y (1 + \\log(D)) + \\mathbf{y} Z.\n\\]",
    "where $Z$ is a Gaussian noise with variance $\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{D} a_i^2 \\right) = 1 + \\log(D).$ Scaling everything by $1/(1 + \\log(D)),$ we see that this is equivalent to observing the signal $y = \\pm 1$ under a zero-mean Gaussian noise with variance $1/(1 + \\log(D))$. Hence as $D$ grows the variance tends to zero and our error probability will go to zero as well. In other words, if we train our ML algorithm well then we can hope to get close to zero standard risk when the dimension D grows.\n\nBut assume now that we allow the adversary to move the point $x$ into $\\tilde{x}$ and that our norm is $\\ell_{\\infty}$ with $c = 2 \\sqrt{\\log D/ D}$. In this case the adversary can do the following. She can first make an optimal decision based on the observation. As we have seen, with high probability she will know the correct label. She can then move each of the non-robust features $i = 2, \\ldots , D$ into the wrong direction by an amount $2 \\sqrt{\\log D/ D}.$ This means that she can in effect flip the non-robust features. She can also move the first component somewhat but this should have no effect. If we ignore for the moment this tiny possibility we see that with this change the adversarial example is essentially the same as the original high probability example. In this case an example where the standard risk is essentially zero but the adversarial risk of the same classifier is almost 1. This is a bad case. The key here was that this is due to the fact that the classifier relied heavily on many very weak features that were easily flipped.\n\nCould have constructed a more robust classifier? Yes, certainly, but at a price. Assume that we build a classifier based on the first feature only. The best classifier in this case",
    "is again a Bayes classifier. A little bit of thought shows that it is given by simply taking the sign of $x_1$. What is the risk of this classifier? We have a label that is either $+1$ or $-1$. We add a zero-mean unit-variance Gaussian random variable to it and ask what is the probability that this noise changes the sign. A little bit of thought shows that the incurred error probability in this case is equal to\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{1} e^{\\frac{x^2}{2}} dx \\sim 0.16.\n$$\nIn words, this classifier incurs a standard risk of about sixteen percent. This is much higher than the standard risk of essentially zero we saw above. But in this case the risk almost does not change if we consider the adversarial setting since in our threat model we allow the adversary to move each component by only a very small amount. So we see in this model a trade-off between a small standard risk and a small adversarial risk. We cannot get both.\n\nThe above example might look a little constructed and also it might not be clear how much of this is due to the fact that we allow the adversary to change all the components in an $\\ell_\\infty$ sense. Indeed, it is more challenging to find simple examples if the threat model consist of changes in $\\ell_2$. But the similar ideas still apply.\n\nThe idea for the above model and further details come from the paper \"Robustness May Be at Odds with Accuracy,\" by Tsipras, Dimitris, Santurkar, Shibani, Engstrom, Logan, Turner, Alexander, and Madry, Aleksander.",
    "Why Some ML Algorithms Might Not Be Robust - The Curse of Dimensionality - Again!\n\nLet us talk about a simple setting to see why in high dimensions adversarial examples cannot be completely avoided. \n\nWe consider a binary classification example. Let us assume that $\\mathbb{X} = \\mathbb{R}^{500}$, i.e., $D = 500$. Our data is perfectly separable. For $y = -1$ the data is distributed uniformly on the surface of a sphere of radius 1 and for $y = 1$ the data is uniformly distributed on the surface of a sphere of radius 1.3. Both classes have equal size.\n\nIn the paper \"The Relationship Between High-Dimensional Geometry and Adversarial Examples,\" by Justin Gilmer, Luke Metz, Fartash Faghri, Samuel S. Schoenholz, Maithra Raghu, Martin Wattenberg, and Ian Goodfellow the authors performed the following experiment.\n\nThey took a 2-hidden layer NN with ReLU activation functions and 500 nodes per hidden layer. They then trained with 50 million samples using SGD. The network trained very well, giving an error below 0.2 million test samples. Yet they found that it was possible to find adversarial examples by moving in the input space.\n\nLet us/now discuss how this is an essentially unavoidable consequence of working in very high dimension.\n\nConsider a classifier $f$ that has a small but non-zero error probability. Consider let's say only those errors where $(x,y)$ such that $\\|x\\|_2 = 1$ and $y = -1$ but $f(x) = 1$. I.e., there are points lying on the inner sphere but that are classified",
    "as belonging to the outer sphere. Let $E$ be the set of such points that are misclassified.\n\nFor a reason that will become clear hopefully soon, assume that this set forms a spherical cap in the $e_1$ direction, i.e., these are the points $x$ of the form $\\|x\\|_2 = 1$ and $x_1 \\ge \\alpha$ for some appropriate constant $\\alpha$. Without loss of generality we can assume that the error probability, call it $p$, fulfills $0 \\le p \\le \\frac{1}{2}$ so that $\\alpha \\ge 0$.\n\nGiven $p$ what is the value of $\\alpha$ that gives us $p$ (recall that we assume a uniform distribution of the data on the sphere)? This amounts to comparing the surface area of the spherical cap, dividing it by the surface area of the whole sphere and equating this ratio to $p$. Recall that the sphere has radius 1. If we are using our low-$D$ intuition we might think that as $p$ varies from 0 to $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\alpha$ will vary from 1 to 0. But in fact, we will see now that $\\alpha$ is of order $1/\\sqrt{D}$ and that $p$ only modulates the constant in front of the expression! This indeed means that as $D$ becomes large, the spherical cap extends almost completely down to the equator. In other words, almost all the mass of the data is at the equator. As a consequence, adversarial examples are essentially unavoidable -- if we randomly misclassify a point, it is likely very close to the equator. And such a point is hence very \u2018likely\u2019 $1/\\sqrt{D}$-close to a point that if misclassified is very 'unlucky', it is easy to find small adversarial moves that will cause this new point to be misclassified!\n\nIt remains to clarify two things. First, let us check to for example above that indeed the spherical cap almost extends all the way down to the equator when $D$ is large and the error probability is non-zero. Second, why did we assume",
    "that the error set forms a spherical cap?\n\nTo answer the first question we will take a convenient short\\-cut. In principle the area of a spherical cap is explicitly known. But the expression is somewhat unwieldy. But note the following. Picking a point uniformly at random on a sphere of radius 1 in \\(D\\)-dimensional real space is almost the same as picking a Gaussian vector with iid zero-mean components of variance \\(\\sigma^2 = 1/D\\). Such a vector will be spherically symmetric and it will have a norm very close to 1. \n\nBut for the latter model it is very easy to assess the probability that this vector extends beyond a positive number \\(\\beta\\) in the first component. This probability is given by\n\\[\n\\int_{\\beta}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2 \\sigma^2}} dx = p.\n\\]\n\nOne way to express this is to define \n\n\\[\nQ(x) = \\int_{x}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} e^{-\\frac{y^2}{2}} dy.\n\\]\n\nE.g., \\( Q(1) = 0.16 \\), i.e., the probability that a zero-mean unit-variance Gaussian has a value larger than 1 is about 16 percent. With this function we get the expression \n\n\\[\nQ (\\beta / \\sigma) = p.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\sigma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{D}}\\), we see from this expression that \\(\\beta\\) must be of the form \\( \\sigma v \\), as claimed. More precisely, \n\n\\[\n\\beta = Q^{-1} (p) / \\sqrt{D}.\n\\]",
    "To answer the second question consider the following. You\nlikely know that, in any dimension and for a fixed volume,\nthe body that has the smallest surface area is the sphere.\nThis is a famous so-called isoperimetric inequalities. Many\nsuch isoperimetric inequalities exist. The version we need is\nthe following. Consider a sphere in $D$ dimensions and a\nsubset $E$ on the surface of this sphere of a fixed size. How\nto add to this subset all points on the sphere that have distance\nno more than $\\epsilon$ away from this set $E$. What is the lowest\nthis set can be?

But we can take a more pro-active approach.\nFirst, we can include the aim for adversarial robustness in\nthe training phase. This is what we discuss now. Second,\ngiven a classifier we can ask if we can modify it to make it\nmore robust. We will briefly discuss this second approach in\nthe next section. In practice we will use both types of\ntechniques. We will begin by the first type.\n\nThe approach taken in the paper \u2018\u2018Towards Deep Learning\nModels Resistant to Adversarial Attacks\u2019\u2019 by Madry, Alek-",
    "sander, Makelov, Aleksandar, Schmidt, Ludwig, Tsipras, Dimitris, and Vladu is the following perhaps most natural idea. Rather than minimizing the usual cost function\n\\[\n    \\min_{\\Theta} \\left[ L(f) = \\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\\sim D} [\\mathcal{L}(f(x),y)]  \\right]\n\\]\nover all parameters $\\Theta$ of the model, why not directly minimize what matters, namely\n\\[\n\\min_{\\Theta} \\left[ R(f, \\epsilon) = \\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\\sim D} \\left[ \\max_{\\|\\delta\\| \\leq \\epsilon} \\frac{1}{\\{f(x+\\delta)\\neq y\\}} \\right] \\right]\n\\]\nThis leads to a min-max formulation. As written, this function is not easy to optimize for several reasons. The first is that it is not smooth (due to the indicator function). Therefore let us instead look at the problem\n\\[\n\\min_{\\Theta} \\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\\sim D} \\left[ \\max_{\\|\\delta\\| \\leq \\epsilon} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - y g(f(x+\\delta) - \\frac{1}{2}) \\right) \\right]\n\\]\nHere we assumed that we deal with a binary classification problem, i.e., $y \\in \\{\\pm1\\}$ and that the classifier $f(x)$ has the form (1) so that $y g(f(x) - \\frac{1}{2})$ is the predicted probability of the incorrect label. Now we are dealing with a smooth function.\nNext, we do not have access to the distribution but instead we have a sample $S$. Therefore the equivalent problem is\n\\[\n\\min_{\\Theta} \\left[ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\max_{\\|\\delta_i\\| \\leq \\epsilon} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - y_i g(f(x_i) - \\frac{1}{2}) \\right) \\right]\n\\]\nIt is still not completely obvious how to minimize this. It turns out that the following is correct. Compute for each $x_n",
    "the worst perturbation $\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}_n$. Then take the gradient of this expression and move towards the negative gradient direction. Of course, this is computationally intensive since for each sample and each iteration we need to find the worst-case perturbation.\n\nLet us apply this algorithm to our example with one robust and many non-robust features. To keep things simple let us assume that we even know that the optimum classifier is of the form as discussed, i.e. first do the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^D x_i a_i$, and then take the sign, but we do not know what the best constants $a_i$ are that we should use. Hence, we are led to the optimization task\n\\[\n\\max_a \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\min_{\\|\\delta\\|\\leq \\epsilon} y_n \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^D (\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}_n)_i a_i + \\lambda \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^D a_i^2 - 1 - \\log (D) \\right) \\right),\n\\]\nwhere $a_i = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\log (D)}}{D-1}$ and we added the term $\\lambda \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^D a_i^2 - 1 - \\log (D) \\right)$ in order to limit the scale of the coefficients. Assume at first that we started with the optimum solution for the non-adversarial setting, i.e., $a_1 = 1$ and $a_i = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\log (D)}}{D-1}$ and let us do one gradient step. The adversary now will move all features in the \"incorrect direction\" by an amount $\\epsilon$. This will leave the robust feature essentially unchanged but will \"flip\" all non-robust features. The gradient will be\n\\[\n(1 - 2a + 2 \\lambda) + \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2 - \\frac{1}{N}), \\quad i = 1,\n\\]\n\\[\n-a (1 - 2\\lambda) + \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2 - \\frac{1}{N}), \\quad i \\ne 1.\n\\]",
    "and we will walk a little bit into the direction of this gradient (in the current setting we want to maximize and not to minimize the given expression). If $N$ is large then the additional noise is negligible and the direction will become deterministic. Further, think of $\\lambda$ as small. We see that the non-robust features will now towards zero.\nIndeed, if we consider as a second example the case where we set $\\alpha_i = 0, i = 2, \\cdots , D$, and pick $\\alpha_1$ to be positive, we see that this is a fixed point of the adversarial training algorithm. This training algorithm is called adversarial training.\n\n\\textbf{Making an Existing Classifier Robust \u2014 Randomized Smoothing}\n\nIn some instances we might be handed a classifier that has small standard risk but might be prone to adversarial errors and are asked to make it more robust rather than learning a new classifier from scratch. To date the perhaps most promising idea of accomplishing this is randomized smoothing.\nLet $f$ be the given classifier. Assume that it maps $\\mathbb{R}^D$ to $\\mathcal{Y}$, the set of labels. From this we derive the smoothed classifier, call it $g$. This new smoothed classifier $g$ maps an input $x$ to that class $c$ that is most likely returned by $f$ if presented with input $x + Z$, where $Z$ is a vector of i.i.d. mean rounded Gaussian variables with a variance of $\\sigma^2$ per component. This idea was introduced by Lecuyer, A., Mittal, P., Mancini, L., Geambasu, R., Hsu, D.,and Jana, S. in the paper entitled \u201cCertified robustness to adversarial examples with",
    "differential privacy\". It was shown to work well for various test data sets like ImageNet. There are several variants of this. E.g., rather than using this probabilistic definition using Gaussians we could average over a ball of radius $\\sqrt{D\\sigma}$ (with a uniform distribution). The effect would be more or less the same. This resulting training algorithm variants are called robust training.\n\nThe basic idea why this adds robustness is the following. Consider e.g. the binary case. Take a point $x$ and consider the original classifier $f$. Let's say that the label $y = 1$ is much more likely to be returned by $f$ if we give it the input $x + z$ than the label $y = -1$. Now consider what happens if we give $f$ the label $x \\neq z$ instead, where $\\|x - x\\|_2 \\le \\sigma$ for some not too large $\\sigma$. Since the resulting points in the two cases are picked with a probability which is not too different, it is intuitive that in average we are still more likely to return $y = 1$ rather than $y = -1$. I.e., we will return the same label for points not too far away. Let us make this precise. Consider the simple case of $D = 1$. I.e., we return points $z$ on a line. On the line each point $x$ has a label $f(x) \\in \\{+1\\}$ attached to it. For a point the neighborhood of $x$ is $p = E[1_{\\{y=x+n\\}}]$. Let us assume that $\\frac{1}{2} \\le p \\le 1$. This means that `more' of the points in the neighborhood of $x$ are given the label $y = 1$ than the label $y = -1$. Consider now $p = E[1_{+q =x+1_{\\|x - x\\|_2 \\le \\sigma}}] < \\sigma$. Assume e.g. the point is moved to the right of the point $x$ with a small gain $p$. A little bit of thought shows that the worst case is if all the points that are originally labeled $y = -1$ were on the right of the point $x$ in the tail of the Gaussian.",
    "More precisely, the worst case happens if all the points to the left of $x + \\sigma Q^{-1}(1 - p)$ are labeled $y = 1$ and all points to the right of this point are labeled $y = -1$. How far can we then move $\\tilde{x}$ to the right away from $x$ so that still the majority of the points is labeled $y = 1$. We see that we can move it at most by $\\sigma Q^{-1}(1 - p)$. This is pleasing. The larger $p$, i.e., the more biased the original average was, the more we are adversarially robust.\n\nThis was in 1-D. But exactly the same happens in any dimension since the noise is Gaussian with iid components. Hence, no matter what direction we are considering, in this direction we are dealing with a Gaussian with zero mean and variance $\\sigma^2$. \n\nSo why not choose a very large $\\sigma$ so that we get a very large robustness radius? The averaging (smoothing) will in general increase the standard risk and it can do so considerably. I.e., there might be a considerable price to pay for the added robustness.",

    "\\textbf{Motivation}\n\nLet us re-consider binary classification with data pairs $(x_n, \\tilde{y}_n), \\tilde{y}_n \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. We use here the notation $\\tilde{y}_n$ to denote variables that take values in $\\{0, 1\\}$ since soon we will transform our labels to take values in $\\{\\pm 1\\}$ and we want to avoid confusion. As we had discussed it, we use the least squares fit (not recommended!) and ignore right now any potential regularization term this lead us to the minimization\n\n$$\n\\min_w \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} (\\tilde{y}_n - x_n^\\top w)^2.\n$$\n\nIf instead we use logistic regression and optimize the log-likelihood, we solve\n\n$$\n\\min_w \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\log(1 + e^{x_n^\\top w}) - \\tilde{y}_n x_n^\\top w.\n$$\n\nIn the following it will be slightly more convenient to assume that $y_n \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}$, where we have the mappings 0 $\\rightarrow -1$ and 1 $\\rightarrow +1$. We can write this compactly as $\\tilde{y}_n = \\frac{1+y_n}{2}$ and equivalently, $\\tilde{y}_n = \\frac{1}{2} (y_n + 1)$.\n\nConsider first the least squares problem. Assume, as always, that the feature vector contains the constant feature 1 and has its component 0. Define $w = (\\tilde{w} + e_0)$, where $e_0$ is the vector of length 1 (the dimension of the feature space) that has a 1 at component 0 and 0 at all other components. Note that this defines a one-to-one mapping between $w$ and $\\tilde{w}$.",

    "This is most easily seen by checking the two cases $\\hat{y}_n = 0 \\leftrightarrow y_n = -1$ and $\\hat{y}_n = 1 \\leftrightarrow y_n = 1$ separately. Note that above, $\\hat{y}$ is the prediction based on the given data point and $y$ is the label associated to the data point. We get support vector machines (SVMs), if instead we use the loss\n$$\\text{Hinge}(z,y) = [1 - yz]_+ = \\max\\{0, 1 - yz\\},$$\nand add a regularization term.\n\n\\textbf{Support Vector Machine}\n\nAs just mentioned, SVMs correspond to the following optimization problem:\n$$\\min_{\\mathbf{w}} \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} [1 - y_n \\mathbf{x}_n^T \\mathbf{w}]_+ + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\|\\mathbf{w}\\|^2.$$\n\nThe next figure compares the cost functions of the mean-squared loss, the logistic loss, and the hinge loss. Note that\n(for least squares we incur a cost whenever we fail to represent the desired value exactly and the cost is symmetric around",
    "the target value. For logistic regression we always incur a cost\nbut the cost is asymmetric - it becomes smaller the further\nwe are \"on the right side\" and it becomes larger the further\nwe are \"on the wrong side\". The hinge loss acts differently.\nOnce we are \"sufficiently far\" on the right side we no longer\npay a cost. But if we are not yet far enough on the correct\nside or if we are on the wrong side we do pay a cost and the\ncost increases linearly the further we are away.\nIn the figure below you see a region in pink. This region\nis called the \"margin.\" It is defined as follows: Take the\nnormal vector that defines the hyperplane. Look at all\nfeature vectors $\\mathbf{x}$ so that $|\\mathbf{x}^\\mathbf{w}| \\le 1$. This is the margin.\nNote that the margin does not only depend on the direction\nof the vector $\\mathbf{w}$ but also its norm. In fact the total width of\nthe margin is equal to $\\frac{2}{||\\mathbf{w}||}$.\n\nIf you are looking for an interpretation: It is the region where\nour prediction is not yet sufficiently \"confident\" (assuming\nthat we get the sign right). The intuition is strongest if we\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{margin_hinge_loss_illustration.png}\n\\end{center}\nlook at the case of separable data. This is shown in the\nfollowing two figures (left with a large margin and therefore\nsmall $||\\mathbf{w}||$, and right with small margin that corresponds",
    "to a large $\\|w\\|$. Assume that $\\lambda$ is small so that the cost function is dominated by the sum over the hinge losses on the left. What will the optimal $w$ look like in this case? It is clear that we want the following:\n\n1. A separating hyperplane.\n\n2. A scaling of $w$ so that no point of the data is in the margin.\n\n3. That separating hyperplane and scaling for which the margin is the largest.\n\nConditions (1) and (2) ensure that there is no cost incurred in the first expression (the sum over the terms $[1 - y_n x_n^T w]_+$). Since by assumption that $\\lambda$ is small this is the dominant term, we cannot hope to do better than having this term be 0. The condition (3) ensures that we have the minimum possible cost associated for the regularization term, i.e. the minimal possible normed squared $\\|w\\|^2$. Geometrically\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{figure1} &\n\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{figure2}\n\\end{array}\n\\]",
    "this corresponds to a hyperplane with maximal \"spacing\" to\nthe left and right, i.e., a hyperplane with maximal margin\n(corresponding to the figure on the left).\n\nNOTE: We have introduced our formulation of SVMs for the\ngeneral case where the data is not necessarily linearly separable. This is sometimes called the soft-margin formulation.\nThe hard-margin formulation concerns the case where the\ndata is linearly separable and where we insist that the decision region is given in terms of a separating hyperplane.\nIn this case the formulation would require us to find a separating hyperplane with minimal $\\|w\\|^2$. In other words, the\noptimal solution is a separating hyperplane with maximal\nmargins. And in this case there must be some feature vectors which lie exactly on the boundaries (otherwise we could\nenlarge the margin, contradicting optimality). These feature\nvectors \"support\" the boundaries and hence the name \"support vector\". For the soft-margin case this interpretation is\nonly approximately true as we have explained in the previous\nparagraphs.\n\n\\textbf{Optimization}\n\nNow where we have established \\textit{what function} we are optimizing, let us look at the question \\textit{how} we can optimize it\nefficiently.\nNote that the function is convex and has a subgradient.",

This is good news!\n\n\\textbf{Duality: The big picture}\n\nWe have just seen that we can use SGD in order to find the optimal parameters for the SVM. We will now discuss an alternative but equivalent formulation via the concept of duality. In some cases this leads to a more efficient implementation. But perhaps more importantly, once we have derived this alternative representation it opens up this naturally to a more general formulation. This is called the kernel trick. We will explicitly discuss this technique in a separate lecture.\n\nLet us say that we are interested in minimizing a function $\\mathcal{L}(w)$. Assume that we can define an auxiliary function $G(w,\\alpha)$ so that \n\n\\[ \\mathcal{L}(w) = \\max_\\alpha G(w,\\alpha) \\]\n\nWe can therefore solve our original problem by solving\n\n\\[ \\min_w \\max_\\alpha G(w,\\alpha) \\]\n\nWe call this the \\textbf{primal} problem. In some cases it might be much easier to find\n\n\\[ \\max_\\alpha \\min_w G(w,\\alpha) \\]",
    "We call this the dual problem. This leads us naturally to the following questions:\n\n1. How do we find a suitable $G(\\mathbf{w}, \\alpha)$?\n\n2. When is it OK to switch $\\min \\limits_\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\max \\limits_{\\alpha}$?\n\n3. When is the dual easier to optimize than the primal?\n\nQ1: How do we find a suitable $G(\\mathbf{w}, \\alpha)$? There is a general theory on this topic (see e.g., Bertsekas\u2019s \u201cNonlinear Programming\u201d for more formal details). But rather than talk about this in the abstract, let us look at our specific problem. We have \n\n\\[ [z]_+ = \\max \\{0, z\\} = \\max_{\\alpha \\in [0,1]} \\alpha z. \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ [1 - y_n \\mathbf{x}_n^T \\mathbf{w}]_+ = \\max_{\\alpha_n \\in [0,1]} \\alpha_n (1 - y_n \\mathbf{x}_n^T \\mathbf{w}). \\]\n\nSo we can rewrite the SVM problem as:\n\n\\[\\min_\\mathbf{w} \\max_{\\alpha \\in [0,1]^N} \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\alpha_n ( 1 - y_n \\mathbf{x}_n^T \\mathbf{w}) + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\| \\mathbf{w} \\|^2\\]\n\nNote that $G(\\mathbf{w}, \\alpha)$ is convex in $\\mathbf{w}$ and linear, hence concave, in $\\alpha$.\n\nQ2: When is it OK to switch max and min?",
    "Note that it is always true that\n\n$$\\max_{\\mathbf{w}} \\min_{\\alpha} G(\\mathbf{w}, \\alpha) \\leq \\min_{\\alpha} \\max_{\\mathbf{w}} G(\\mathbf{w}, \\alpha).$$\n\nThis is easy to see:\n\n$$\\min_{\\alpha} G(\\mathbf{w}', \\alpha) \\leq G(\\mathbf{w}', \\alpha) \\; \\forall \\mathbf{w}, \\alpha \\Leftrightarrow$$\n$$\\max_{\\mathbf{w}'} \\min_{\\alpha} G(\\mathbf{w}', \\alpha) \\leq \\max_{\\mathbf{w}'} G(\\mathbf{w}', \\alpha) \\; \\forall \\mathbf{w} \\Leftrightarrow$$\n$$\\max_{\\mathbf{w}} \\min_{\\alpha} G(\\mathbf{w}, \\alpha) \\leq \\min_{\\alpha} \\max_{\\mathbf{w}} G(\\mathbf{w}, \\alpha).$$\n\nWe get equality if $G(\\mathbf{w}, \\alpha)$ is a continuous function that is convex in $\\mathbf{w}$, concave in $\\alpha$, and the domain of $\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\alpha$ are both compact and convex. I.e., in this case we have\n\n$$\\min_{\\alpha} \\max_{\\mathbf{w}} G(\\mathbf{w}, \\alpha) = \\max_{\\mathbf{w}} \\min_{\\alpha} G(\\mathbf{w}, \\alpha).$$",
    "In other words, we get equality if we have functions that look \nlike saddles as in the previous figure. \nFor SVMs the condition is fulfilled and we can switch the \nmin and max.

    "\\textbf{Motivation}\n\n\\textit{Principal component analysis} (PCA) is a popular method for \\textit{dimensionality reduction}. The idea is simple. Given the data matrix, we are looking for a linear mapping of the $D$-dimensional input into a $K$-dimensional space, $K \\leq D$, that \u201cbest\u201d represents the original data. In other words, we \u201ccompress\u201d the data with as small as possible distortion. There is also a second interpretation of the PCA. We are looking for a linear transformation of the $D$-dimensional input into a $K$-dimensional space, $K \\leq D$, that has maximum variance. This can also be phrased probabilistically, as asking for a linear transform that \u201cdecorrelates\u201d the data. In the end we will see that all these questions lead to the same answer and that this answer can be computed from the data matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ via the so-called \\textit{singular value decomposition} (SVD). PCA has strong connections to matrix factorizations, some of which we\u2019ve already seen.\n\nIn all our subsequent discussion, $\\mathbf{X}$ is the $D \\times N$ data matrix whose $N$ columns represent the input datapoints in $D$-dimensional space.\n\n\\textbf{SVD}\n\nWe start with the singular value decomposition (SVD). Recall that any $D \\times N$ matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ can be written in the form\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{U} \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{V}^\\top.\n\\]\n\nThis decomposition is depicted graphically in Figure 1. For simplicity in the following we assume that  $D < N$. This",
    "\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\textwidth]{../figures/SVD_transpose}\n\\caption{\\normalsize Graphique de la description du SVD.}\n\\label{fig:SVD_transpose}\n\\end{figure}\n\nis an arbitrary choice, but by consistently sticking with this convention it will make it easier to tell the dimensions apart. Here, $\\mathbf{U}$ is of size $D \\times D$ and $\\mathbf{V}$ is of size $N \\times N$ and both matrices are unitary\\footnote{Our notation assumes that the matrix is real-valued. In this case all the statements in the SVD are about real orthogonal matrices, but if the integer entries are extended to the complex numbers, then these become unitary transformations. The only caveat is that in this case the transpose operator is replaced by the Hermitian transpose. This issue does not affect the explanations below and so we avoid this additional level of abstraction and work purely in the real-valued case.}, i.e.,\n\n\\[\n    \\mathbf{UU}^T = \\mathbf{U}^T \\mathbf{U} = I_{D \\times D},\n\\]\n\\[\n    \\mathbf{VV}^T = \\mathbf{V}^T \\mathbf{V} = I_{N \\times N}.\n\\]\n\nRecall that the condition $\\mathbf{UU}^T = I_{D \\times D}$ means that the matrix $\\mathbf{U}$ has orthonormal (i.e., orthogonal and norm 1) rows and that $\\mathbf{U}^T = \\mathbf{U}^{-1}$. But if $\\mathbf{UU}^T = I_{D \\times D}$ then also $\\mathbf{U}^T \\mathbf{U} = \\mathbf{U}^{-1} \\mathbf{U} = I_{D \\times D}$ so that also the columns of $\\mathbf{U}$ are orthonormal. Therefore, requiring that a square matrix is unitary, is the same as requiring that it has orthonormal rows.",
    "rows, or requiring that it has orthonormal columns. \nOne useful property of a unitary matrix is that the linear \ntransform it represents can be interpreted as a \u201crotation\u201d, \ni.e., it does not change the length of the vector that is being \ntransformed: \n\n\\[\n||Ux||_2^2 = x^T U^T Ux = x^T x = ||x||_2^2. \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\n\nThe matrix $S$ is a diagonal matrix of size $D \u00d7 N$ with non-\nnegative entries along the diagonal. These diagonal entries \nare called the singular values. The columns of $U$ and $V$ are \ncalled the left and right singular vectors, respectively. \nBy convention, the singular values appear in a descending \norder in $S$, i.e., we have $s_1 \u2265 s_2 \u2265 s_3 ... \u2265  s_D \u2265 0$, where $s_j$ \nis the $j$-th singular value.\nWe will see that this transform plays a key role in our dis- \ncussion. We will take this representation for granted and not \ngive a proof at this stage. But we will show how to perform an \noptimal dimensionality reduction given this representation.\n\n\\textbf{SVD and Dimensionality Reduction}\n\nWe want to \u201ccompress\u201d the data matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ from dimension $D$ \nto lets say dimension $K, 1 \u2264  K \u2264 D $. More precisely, we\nare looking for a linear transform given by the $K \u00d7 D$ matrix \n$\\mathbf{C}$ (the compression) and a second linear transform given by \nthe $D \u00d7 K$ matrix $\\mathbf{R}$ (the reconstruction) so that \n\n\\[\n||\\mathbf{X} \u2212 \\mathbf{RC}\\mathbf{X}||_F^2\n\\]\n\nis minimized over all choices of $\\mathbf{C}$ and $\\mathbf{R}$.",
    "In words, we want to compress the $D \\times N$ data matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ into the $K \\times N$ matrix $\\mathbf{CX}$ in such a way that the data is represented \"as faithful as possible\".\n\nHow do we measure the quality of the representation? We ask that the reconstruction $\\mathbf{RCX}$ differs from the original matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ as little as possible in the sense that the Frobenius norm of their difference is small, where \n\n$$\\|\\mathbf{A}\\|_F^2 = \\sum_{ij} |\\mathbf{A}_{ij}|^2.$$\n\nNote that there are other natural ways of measuring the quality of a reconstruction but for simplicity we stick to this one measure.\n\n\\textbf{Lemma.} For any $D \\times N$ matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ and any $D \\times N$ rank-$K$ matrix $\\mathbf{\\hat{X}}$ \n\n$$\\|\\mathbf{X} - \\mathbf{\\hat{X}}\\|_F^2 \\geq \\|\\mathbf{X} - \\mathbf{U}_K \\mathbf{U}_K^T \\mathbf{X}\\|_F^2 = \\sum_{j > K} \\sigma_j^2,$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{USV}^T$ is the SVD of $\\mathbf{X}$, the $\\sigma_j$ are the singular values of $\\mathbf{X}$, and $\\mathbf{U}_K$ is the $D \\times K$ matrix consisting of the first $K$ columns of $\\mathbf{U}$.\n\nWe state a proof of this fact at the end of these notes. Recall that the columns of $\\mathbf{U}$ are called the left singular vectors of $\\mathbf{X}$. What the lemma tells us is that we should compress the data by projecting it onto those left singular vectors. Moreover, projecting onto the top $K$ singular vectors minimizes the residual Frobenius norm.^7\n\n\\footnote{$^7$The following lemma is also correct if we use the spectral norm, i.e., the magnitude of the largest (non\u2212singular) eigenvalue.}",
    "data is contained in the projection onto the first left singular vector, the second most important information is contained in the projection onto the second left singular vector etc. So the components are ordered in terms of importance, with the most important one being the first. In other words, our analysis/processing takes the data as the principal/most important components. This is why the above scheme is called the principal component analysis (PCA).\n\nThe expression $U_k U_k^T X$ has a very simple interpretation. Let $S(k)$ be the $D \\times N$ diagonal matrix that is equal to $S$ for the first $K$ diagonal entries but is $0$ thereafter. We claim that \n\\[\nU_k U_k^T X = U_k U_k^T U S V^T = U S^{(k)} V^T. \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\nWith this interpretation, the lemma states that the best rank-$K$ approximation to a matrix $X$ is obtained by computing the SVD and by setting all the singular values $s_{j j}, \\, j \\ge K+1$ to zero. \n\nThe claim (2) is easily seen by checking that\n\\[\nU_k^T U = \n\\begin{pmatrix} \n    I_K & 0 \n\\end{pmatrix} \n\\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times D}\n\\]\n\nis a $D \\times D$ matrix whose first $K$ columns are the $K$ identity and whose remaining columns are 0.\n\n\\textbf{Example Application.} Let us now discuss the implications of the SVD. One way to visualize these implications is the speed of convergence for the least square problem, \n\\[\n\\min_{\\theta} \\| XD_l - Y \\|_2^2.\n\\]\nFor each image, we take the vector of $D$ pixels that represent a single image. We can then compress an image by running \n",

The large image on the right is reconstructed from the top $K = 10$ principal components.}\n\nSVD and compress the picture with the scheme above, projecting the image onto the first $K$ columns of $U$. To see how well this works we can then reconstruct this image back to the original image space $\\mathbb{R}^D$ and visualize it next to its original. This is shown in Figure 2 above$^3$.\nNote that this is a slightly different application of what we had in mind when we started -- as here we care about the compression, not so much about the lower-dimensional representations in $\\mathbb{R}^D$. But it gives a good intuition why this is a useful method.

Let us now discuss how the SVD relates to this problem.\nAssume that we are given the data matrix $\\mathbf{X}$. Use the SVD to write it as $\\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{USV}^T$.\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{USV}^T = \\mathbf{U} \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mathbf{S} & \\mathbf{0} \\\\\n\\mathbf{0} & \\mathbf{0} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\mathbf{V}^T\n\\]\n\nSo we have achieved a perfect factorization of our data matrix.\n\nThere are two differences compared to matrix factorization problems.\n\nFirst, in the matrix factorization problem we typically restrict $\\mathbf{W}$ and $\\mathbf{Z}$ to have few columns only, lets say $K$, where",
    "in SVD we can control the rank at any time later, and can let it range up to $\\min \\{ D,N \\}$. Of course, in the low-rank case we cannot hope for a perfect factorization but we are looking for the best possible approximation.\nThis difference can be easily addressed as we have already seen. Let $1 \\le K \\le \\min \\{ D,N \\}$. Let $S^{(K)}$ be the matrix that is equal to $S$ except that all singular values $s_j$ for $j \\ge K+1$ are set to zero. We have seen this matrix already in our discussion of the SVD.\nThis gives us the rank-$K$ approximation\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{X}_K := \\mathbf{U} S^{(K)} \\mathbf{V}^\\top , \\]\n\nand indeed, as we have discussed, it is the best rank-$K$ approximation that we can find in the sense that the Frobenius norm of the difference is the smallest possible and is equal to $\\sum_{i>K} s_i^2$, where the $s_j$ are again the singular values of $\\mathbf{X}$.\n\nWe can again write the above approximation in a factorized form. Again, let $\\mathbf{U}_K$ be the matrix consisting of the first $K$ columns of $\\mathbf{U}$. Similar to before we can now write\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{X}_K = \\mathbf{U}_K S^{(K)} \\mathbf{V}^\\top = \\underbrace{\\mathbf{U}_K S(1:K,1:K)}_{\\mathbf{W}} \\underbrace{\\mathbf{V}^\\top}_{\\mathbf{Z}} = \\mathbf{WZ}^\\top , \\]\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{W}$ is a $D \\times K$ matrix and $\\mathbf{Z}^\\top$ is a $K \\times N$ matrix.\n\nThe second difference is that in general matrix factorization problems we can have data matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ that has entirely missing entries. Indeed, one can construct a low-rank factorization that does make use of the known values in order to predict",
    "the missing values, as we will see in the next lecture. The method using the SVD on the other hand starts with a complete data matrix. There does not seem to be an easy fix to adapt the SVD to the case of missing values. And so we see that despite some similarities between these problems there are also some significant differences.\n\n\\textbf{PCA and Decorrelation}\n\nThere is another, probabilistic, view-point that gives insight why the PCA is a good idea. Assume that the $D$-dimensional data points are generated in an i.i.d. fashion according to some unknown distribution $\\mathcal{D}_X$. These N data points form the columns of our $D \\times N$ matrix $\\mathbf{X}$. Let us compute the empirical/sample mean and co-variance. We have:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{x} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\mathbf{x}_n \\quad, \\quad \\mathbf{K} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^N (\\mathbf{x}_n - \\mathbf{x})(\\mathbf{x}_n - \\mathbf{x})^{\\top}\n\\]\nIf indeed the data comes from i.i.d. samples then the sample mean will converge to the true mean and the sample covariance matrix will converge to the true covariance matrix as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\nAssume that we have pre-processed the data matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ by subtracting the mean from each row. Using the SVD, the empirical covariance matrix can be written as\n\\[\n\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{K} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\mathbf{x}_n \\mathbf{x}_n^{\\top}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} = \\mathbf{U} \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{V}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V} \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{U}^{\\top} = \\mathbf{US}^2 \\mathbf{U}^{\\top} = \\mathbf{US}_D^2 \\mathbf{U}^{\\top}\n\\]",
    "where $S_D$ is the $D \\times D$ diagonal matrix consisting of the $D$ first columns of $S$.\n\nNow consider instead the transformed data $\\mathbf{\\hat{X}} = \\mathbf{U}^T \\mathbf{X}$. It has a sample co-variance matrix of \n\\[\n\\mathbf{\\hat{K}} = \\mathbf{\\hat{X}} \\mathbf{\\hat{X}}^T = \\mathbf{U}^T \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{U} = \\mathbf{U}^T \\mathbf{U} S_D^2 \\mathbf{U}^T \\mathbf{U} = S_D^2.\n\\]\nThis means, we have linearly transformed the data in such a way that the empirical co-variance matrix is diagonal, i.e., the various components are uncorrelated. This gives us some intuition why it is perhaps useful to first linearly transform the data via the \"rotation\" $\\mathbf{U}^T \\mathbf{X}$.\n\nMore is true. Note that by definition of the SVD, the first singular value, $s_1$, is the largest of all singular values. and the empirical variance of the first feature component is equal to $s_1^2$ according to our calculation. This means that of all the components in our feature vector $\\mathbf{X}$, the first component has the largest variance.\n\nAssume that we are doing classification. It is then intuitive that it is easier to classify features that have a large variance than a small one. An extreme example is a random data set with a sample co-variance matrix. In the extreme case where the variance is 0 in a particular component, i.e., the data is constant in this component, then this component is not useful for classification.\n\nFrom this point of view, it is then intuitive why it is good to keep the first $K$ rows of $\\mathbf{X}$ when we perform a dimensionality reduction: These are the components that have the highest variance and they are uncorrelated.",
    "To make sure that we understand the probabilistic interpretation of PCA, let us consider the following example. Let $x_j$ be i.i.d. samples from a $D$-dimensional Gaussian of mean zero and with covariance matrix\n$$\nK = QAQ^T,\n$$\nwhere $Q$ is a $D \\times D$ unitary matrix and $A$ is a diagonal matrix with strictly non-zero entries. Let $X$ be the resulting $D \\times N$ data matrix. Assume that we run a PCA on this matrix without any preprocessing. Under the assumption that all eigenvalues are distinct and that $N$ tends to infinity what do you expect $U$ to be? What could happen if some of the eigenvalues are equal?\n\n\\textbf{How to Compute U and S Efficiently}\nWe start again with the SVD\n$$\nX = USV^T.\n$$\nWe have seen in our discussion that for applications we need to compute $U$ and $S$. Let us see how we can do this efficiently.\n\nConsider the $D \\times D$ matrix $XX^T$. We have\n$$\nXX^T = USS^T U^T = US^2 U^T.\n$$\nLet $u_j$, $j = 1, \\ldots, D$, denote the columns of $U$. Then\n$$\nXX^T u_j = US^2 U^T u_j = s_j^2 u_j.\n$$",
    "So we see that the $j$\\nobreakdash-th column of $\\mathbf{U}$ is an \\textcolor{blue}{eigenvector} of $\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{X}^\\top$ with eigenvalue $s_j^2$. Therefore, solving the eigenvector/value problem for the matrix $\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{X}^\\top$ gives us a way to compute $\\mathbf{U}$ and $\\mathbf{S}$.\u00a0\n\nThere is a subtle point here. If $\\mathbf{u}_j$ is an eigenvector of $\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{X}^\\top$ then so is $-\\mathbf{u}_j$. So the signs of the columns of $\\mathbf{U}$ are not determined by this procedure. If we just want to compute $\\mathbf{X}_k$ in order to project $\\mathbf{X}$ onto its columns (PCA) then this sign does not matter since $\\mathbf{U}_k \\mathbf{U}_k^\\top$ is invariant to sign changes of columns of $\\mathbf{U}_k$.\n\nAnd what do we do if we want to determine the SVD? In this case the sign of the columns of $\\mathbf{U}$ is also not determined uniquely, it just has to be matched to the sign of the columns of $\\mathbf{V}$. Therefore, solve the above eigenvalue/eigenvector problem and fix some choice of signs to determine a $D \\times D$ matrix $\\mathbf{U}$ consisting of eigenvectors of $\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{X}^\\top$. To find the matching $\\mathbf{V}$ just compute $\\mathbf{U}^\\top \\mathbf{X}$. This is equal to $\\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{V}^\\top$ but we know that the entries of $\\mathbf{S}$ are non-negative, so we can easily complete the matching $\\mathbf{V}$.\n\nIn the exercises you will see that you can either solve the eigenvector problem for $\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{X}^\\top$ or the one for $\\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{X}$. This comes in handy since we can then always work with the smaller of the two dimensions $D$ and $N$.\n\n\\small{*Strictly speaking we do not compute the singular values $s_j$, but their squares $s_j^2$. But since we know that the singular values are non-negative we can just take the square root.}",
    "\\textbf{Pitfalls of PCA}\n\nAt this point it might seem that the PCA is a miracle cure. Just take the data, compute the SVD, and compress. But note that the SVD is not invariant under scalings of the features in the original matrix $\\mathbf{X}$. I.e., the final representation we get does depend on how we scale our individual features vectors and so there is a large degree of arbitrariness. It therefore remains very important that the data is normalized properly. Experience shows that it is a good idea to remove the mean of each feature and to normalize the variance to one.\n\n\\textbf{Proof of the SVD Lemma}\n\nLet us now prove our lemma. In fact, there are two parts that we need to show. First, let us show that if we pick the compressor and decompressor as prescribed in the statement we get\n\n\\[\n\\|\\mathbf{X} - \\mathbf{U}_k \\mathbf{U}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{X}\\|_F^2 = \\sum_{i=k+1}^r S_i^2.\n\\]\n\nWe have seen already in (2) that\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{U}_k \\mathbf{U}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{U} S^{(k)} \\mathbf{V}^\\mathsf{T},\n\\]\n\nwhere $S^{(k)}$ is a $D \\times N$ diagonal matrix that is equal to $\\mathbf{S}$ for the first $k$ diagonal entries but is 0 thereafter. Let $S^{(k)} = S - S^{(r)}$. Then\n\n\\[\n\\|\\mathbf{X} - \\mathbf{U}_k \\mathbf{U}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{X}\\|_F^2 = \\|\\mathbf{U} \\mathbf{S}^{(r)} \\mathbf{V}^\\mathsf{T}\\|_F^2.\n\\]",

    "\\textbf{Motivation}\n\nIn rare cases, one can compute the optimum of the cost function analytically. Linear regression using a mean-squared error cost function is one such case. Here the solution can be obtained explicitly, by solving a linear system of equations. These equations are sometimes called the \\textit{normal equations}. This method is one of the most popular methods for data fitting. It is called \\textit{least squares}.\n\nTo derive the normal equations, we first show that the problem is convex. We then use the optimality conditions for convex functions (see the previous lecture notes on optimization). I.e., at the optimum parameter, call it $\\mathbf{w}^*$, it must be true that the gradient of the cost function is 0. I.e.,\n\n\\[ \n\\nabla \\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w}^*) = 0.\n\\]\n\nThis is a system of $D$ equations.",
    "\\textbf{Normal Equations}\n\nRecall that the cost function for linear regression with mean-squared error is given by\n\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w}) = \\frac{1}{2N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} (y_n - \\mathbf{x}_n^\\top \\mathbf{w})^2 = \\frac{1}{2N} (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{Xw})^\\top (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{Xw}), $$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\begin{bmatrix}\ny_1 \\\\\ny_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\ny_N\n\\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{X} = \\begin{bmatrix}\nx_{11} & x_{12} & \\cdots & x_{1D} \\\\\nx_{21} & x_{22} & \\cdots & x_{2D} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\nx_{N1} & x_{N2} & \\cdots & x_{ND}\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\nWe claim that this cost function is convex in the $\\mathbf{w}$. There are several ways of proving this:\n\n1. Simplest way: observe that $\\mathcal{L}$ is naturally represented as the sum (with positive coefficients) of the simple terms $(y_n - \\mathbf{x}_n^\\top \\mathbf{w})^2$. Further, each of these simple terms is the composition of a linear function with a convex function (the square function). Therefore, each of these simple terms is convex and hence the sum is convex.",

For the present case a computation shows that the Hessian has the form\n\n$$\\frac{1}{N} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X}.$$\n\nThis matrix is indeed positive semidefinite since its non-zero eigenvalues are the squares of the non-zero singular values of the matrix $\\mathbf{X}$.",

    "\\textbf{Geometric Interpretation}\n\nThe error is orthogonal to all columns of $\\mathbf{X}$. The span of $\\mathbf{X}$ is the space spanned by the columns of $\\mathbf{X}$. Every element of the span can be written as $\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{Xw}$ for some choice of $\\mathbf{w}$. Which element of $\\mathbf{span(X)}$ shall we take? The normal equations tell us that the optimum choice for $\\mathbf{u}$, call it $\\mathbf{u}^*$, is that element so that $\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{u}^*$ is orthogonal to $\\mathbf{span(X)}$.

Consider the very simple one-dimensional example in Fig. 1. The horizontal axis represents the input $x$ and the vertical axis the output $y$. Our aim is to find a model for this data. It is very natural in this case that we try a linear model: $y = xu + u0 + Z$. I.e., we model the data as a line plus noise. Perhaps the most natural choice for the noise is a zero-mean Gaussian with some variance $\\sigma^2$. As we discussed, this leads to least squares, assuming that we think of the data samples as independent and that we maximize the likelihood. This is what is typically meant when people talk about linear models (of course the data could be higher dimensional).\n\nNow consider the data given in Fig. 2. In this case a linear",
    "\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics{figure2.png}\n\\end{center}\n\\textbf{Figure 2:}\n\nmodel would not be a good fit. We have seen how we can \nget around this problem. Just add some additional features, \ne.g., $x^2$ and $x^3$. If we now use again a linear model, but in \nthe extended feature space then we should be able to model \nthe data well. So the idea was to augment or transform the \nfeature space.\n\nBut this is not the only option we have. Note that in the \nexample above the linear model predicts the mean of a dis-\ntribution from which we then assume the data was sampled. \nExplicitly, we had $y = xu + w + Z$, where $xu + w$ is the \nprediction of the linear model and represents the mean (i.e., \nthe putatively \u201ctrue\u201d value for this data point) and then we \nget a noisy version as a sample. Here is now the extra degree \nof freedom we have: Instead of using the linear model to \npredict the mean of the distribution we can use it to predict",
    "\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figure3.png}\n\nFigure 3:\n\\end{center}\n\na different quantity.\n\nWe have already seen an example when we talked about logistic regression. Consider the data given in Fig 3, where all the $y$ values are in $\\{0, 1\\}$. This might correspond to a binary classification problem. Recall that in logistic regression we model the probability of the two classes $\\{0, 1\\}$ given the data $\\mathbf{x}$ by\n\\[\np(y = 1 | \\eta) = \\sigma(\\eta),\n\\]\n\\[\np(y = 0 | \\eta) = 1 - \\sigma(\\eta),\n\\]\nwhere $\\eta$ is a shorthand for $\\mathbf{x}^\\top \\mathbf{w}$.

    "where $y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. Note that linear model predicts $\\eta$, $\\eta = x^\\top w$, and that $\\eta$ is not the mean of the distribution. Rather, $\\eta$ is related to the mean $\\mu$ by the non-linear relation $\\eta = h\\left( \\frac{\\mu - l^\\top}{\\mu - l^\\top} \\right)$. This relation between the parameter we predict by the linear model and the mean is called the \\textit{link function}. It is exactly this nonlinear link function that makes it possible to use a linear model in this context.\n\n\\textbf{Outline}\n\nAs you can see, we rewrote this distribution used in logistic regression in a very specific form. Our aim for today will be to generalize this form: We will see that there are many other distributions that can be written in this form. This will lead us to the class of distributions known as exponential families. We will first spend some time to talk about this family. We will see that many distributions (but not all) fit into this framework and that distributions in this family have some nice properties. We will only discuss some of these properties. Exponential families are also those distributions that have maximum entropy given some moment constraints and have an extremal also in other contexts. You are likely to already come across this family in other contexts, as families with differing notation to refer to how you will work in this family. As a second step we then discuss how exponential families can be used in the context of ML. In some cases this is even as simple as using new different link functions, i.e., different functions that relate the parameter we predict by the linear model to the mean of the distribution. And this degree of freedom can be useful when we are trying to find a good",
    "model for a given set of data.\nIn the subsequent discussion we consider various exponential\nfamilies and then compute the corresponding link functions.\nBut conceptually it can also be fruitful to think in the reverse\nway. What should the relationship be between the parameter\nthat the linear model predicts and the mean of the distribution\nin order to fit the data well. I.e., perhaps we start with\na desired link function and then find the exponential family\nthat gives us this relationship.\n\nExponential family \u2013 Definition\n\nLet $y$ be a scalar and $\\eta$ be a vector. We will say that a\ndistribution belongs to the exponential family if it can be\nwritten in the form\n\\[\np(y|\\eta) = h(y) \\exp \\left[ \\eta^T \\phi(y) - A(\\eta) \\right]. \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nLet us look at the various components of this distribution.\nThe parameter vector $\\eta$ is often referred to as the natural\nor canonical parameter. The quantity $\\phi(y)$ is in general a\nvector and it is called a sufficient statistics. Why is $\\phi(y)$\ncalled a sufficient statistics? Assume that we are given inde-\npendent samples from this distribution. We do know $h(y)$\nand $h(y)$ but we do not know the parameter $\\eta$. It turns out\nthat we can estimate $\\eta$ using an average of the samples\nwith respect to the vector average of the $\\phi(y)$. In other words,\n$\\phi(y)$ contains all necessary information.\nNote that the expression in (1) is non-negative if $h(y) \\geq 0$.\nSo we only need to ensure that it is properly normalized, i.e.,",
    "we require that\n\\[\n\\int_y h(y) \\exp \\left[ \\eta^\\top \\Phi(y) - A(\\eta) \\right] dy = 1.\n\\]\nRewriting this we see that\n\\[\n\\int_y h(y) \\exp \\left[ \\eta^\\top \\Phi(y) \\right] dy = e^{A(\\eta)}. \\tag{2}\n\\]\nWe see from the last expression that the only role of $A(\\eta)$ is to ensure a proper normalization. $A(\\eta)$ is sometimes called the \\textit{cumulant} and some times it is called the \\textit{log partition function}. We will see shortly that despite the fact that $A(\\eta)$ is only there for normalization purposes it plays a crucial role and contains valuable information. \n\nIf you look at the definition of the exponential family, you will see that we have several \"degrees of freedom\" to define an element of the family. First, we can choose the family $\\{h(y)\\},$ we can choose the vector $\\Phi(y),$ and we can choose the parameter $\\eta.$ For every choice we will get an altogether new exponential family. The term $A(\\eta)$ is then determined for each such choice and assures that every expression is properly normalized as discussed. Of course it can happen that for some parameters $\\eta,$ $A(\\eta) = \\infty$ in which case there is a problem with the expression because the integral is invalid. E.g., set $h(y) = 1$, $\\Phi(y) = y^2$ and $\\eta = 1.$ We will exclude such parameters by only looking at the set of parameters\n\\[\nM := \\left\\{ \\eta \\bigg| \\int_y h(y) \\exp \\left[ \\eta^\\top \\Phi(y) \\right] dy < \\infty \\right\\}. \n\\]",

In fact, we have a 1-1 relationship between $\\eta$ and $\\mu$:\n\n$$\n\\eta = g(\\mu) = \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\mu}{1 - \\mu} \\right) \\Rightarrow \\mu = g^{-1} (\\eta) = \\frac{e^{\\eta}}{1 + e^{\\eta}} .\n$$",
    "As we mentioned in the very beginning, this function $g$ is known as the \\textit{link function} (it links the mean of $\\phi(y)$ to the parameter $\\eta$).\nNote that this is exactly the same distribution that we encountered when we discussed logistic regression.\n\\textbf{Example:} Consider the Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu$.\nWe have, for $y \\in \\mathbb{N}$,\n$$\np(y|\\mu) = \\frac{\\mu^y e^{-\\mu}}{y!}\n= \\frac{(\\frac{1}{h(y)})e^{y \\ln(\\mu) - \\mu}}{y!}\n= \\frac{1}{h(y)}e^{y(\\ln(\\mu)) - \\mu},\n$$\nwhere $h(y) = \\frac{1}{y!}$, $\\phi(y) = y$, $y = g(\\mu) = \\ln(\\mu)$, and $\\mu = g^{-1}(\\eta) = e^\\eta$. Here again, $g(\\mu)$ links the mean to the parameter $\\eta$.\n\\textbf{Example:} The Gaussian distribution with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$ as parameters is also a member of the exponential family.

    "Note that this in particular shows that the Hessian of $A(\\eta)$ is a covariance matrix and hence is positive sem\\-i-definite. This gives us a second proof that $A(\\eta)$ is convex.\nBefore we prove this, let us check this for our two running examples. Recall that for the Bernoulli distribution $\\phi(y)$ is a scalar, namely $y$. So in this case the first derivative should be the mean of the Bernoulli distribution and the second derivative the variance. Let us verify this. We get\n$${\\frac{\\partial A(\\eta)}{\\partial \\eta}} = {\\frac{d\\ln(1+e^{\\eta})}{d\\eta}} = {\\frac{e^{\\eta}}{1+e^{\\eta}}} = \\sigma(\\eta) = \\mu,$$\n$${\\frac{\\partial^2 A(\\eta)}{\\partial \\eta^2}} = {\\frac{d\\sigma(\\eta)}{d\\eta}} = \\sigma(\\eta)(1-\\sigma(\\eta)) = \\mu(1-\\mu),$$\nwhich confirms the claim.\nFor the Gaussian distribution our vector $\\phi(y)$ is of the form $(y, y^2)^{\\top}$. So the first derivative (gradient) should give us the mean and the second moment of the Gaussian. The second derivative should give us the variance of various moments of y.

Let us just write down the proof regarding the first derivative. The proof for the second derivative proceeds in a similar fashion. We have\n\n$$\\nabla A(\\eta) = \\nabla \\left[ \\int h(y) \\exp [ \\eta^\\top \\phi(y)] \\, dy \\right] = \\int \\nabla h(y) \\exp [ \\eta^\\top \\phi(y)] \\, dy = \\int h(y) \\exp [ \\eta^\\top \\phi(y)] \\phi(y) \\, dy = \\exp A(\\eta) = \\int h(y) \\exp [ \\eta^\\top \\phi(y) - A(\\eta)] \\phi(y) \\, dy = \\mathbf{E} [\\phi(y)].$$\n\nIn the second step we have exchanged the derivative with the integral. Note that the exchange of differentiation and integration is permitted if the resulting integral is finite (which it is in our case).\n\nLink function\n\nAs we have seen already in two specific cases (Bernoulli and Poisson), there is a relationship between the \"mean\" $\\mu = $",

But we could have started with the parameters $(\\mu, \\; \\mu^2 + \\sigma^2)$ (which now corresponds to $\\mathbb{E}[\\phi(y)] = \\mathbb{E}[ y, \\; y^2 ]^\\top$ instead).

We assume that these are independent samples from some distribution. Further, we assume that they come from some exponential family with a given $h(y)$ and sufficient statistics $\\phi(y)$ but unknown parameter vector $\\eta$. We now want to determine $\\hat{\\eta}$ -- the value of $\\eta$ that is closest. Only it is $ \\hat{\\eta}$ to estimate the parameter $\\eta$. We use maximum likelihood",
    "principle to find this parameter. Hence we minimize\n\n$$\nL(\\eta) = \\frac{1}{N} \\ln (p(y|\\eta))\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} [- \\ln(h(y_n)) - \\eta^\\top \\Phi(y_n) + A(\\eta)].\n$$\n\nWe see that this is a convex function in $\\eta$ since $A(\\eta)$ is a convex function. Further, if we assume that we can determine the link function we can derive the solution in an explicit form by taking the gradient and setting it to zero:\n\n$$\n\\nabla L(\\eta) = -\\left( \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\Phi(y_n) \\right) + E [\\Phi(y)] = 0.\n$$\n\nThis equation makes sense intuitively. It says that we should pick $\\eta$ in such a way that the expected value of the sufficient statistics is equal to its empirical value! In formula,\n\n$$\n\\eta = g \\left( \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\Phi(y_n) \\right).\n$$\n\nWe now see the justification for why we called $\\Phi(y)$ a sufficient statistics.\n\n\\textbf{Generalized Linear Models}\n\nGiven an element from the exponential family with a scalar $g(y)$, we can construct from this a data model by assuming that a sample $(x, y)$ follows the distribution\n\n$$\np(y| \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{w}) = h(y) e^{x^\\top \\mathbf{w} g(y) - A(x^\\top \\mathbf{w})}.\n$$",
    "We call such a model a \\textit{generalized linear model}. Just note: If we had chosen $\\mathbf{w}$ to be a matrix instead of a vector then we could build generalized linear models using exponential families with non-scalar parameters. Not much changes. To keep things simple we stick to the scalar case.\n\nIt is a generalization of the data model we used for logistic regression. As we will now discuss, for such a model the maximum likelihood problem is particularly easy to solve. Assume that we have given a training set $S_{\\mathrm{train}}$ consisting of $N$ independent samples $(\\mathbf{x}_n, y_n)$. Assume further that we fit a generalized linear model to this data. This means that we assume that samples obey a distribution of the form\n\n$$\np(y_n | \\mathbf{x}_n, \\mathbf{w}) = h(y_n)e^{\\eta_n y_n - A(\\eta_n)}\n$$\n\nwith $\\eta_n = \\mathbf{x}_n^T \\mathbf{w}$. Given $S_{\\mathrm{train}}$ we then write down the likelihood and look for that weight vector $\\mathbf{w}$ that maximizes this likelihood.\n\nIn more detail, we consider the cost function\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w}) = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_n \\ln p(y_n| \\mathbf{x}_n, \\mathbf{w})\n$$\n\n$$\n= -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_n \\left[ \\ln (h(y_n)) + \\mathbf{x}_n^T \\mathbf{w} \\, y_n - A(\\mathbf{x}_n^T \\mathbf{w}) \\right]\n$$\n\nWe want to minimize this cost function (we added a minus sign). First, note that this cost function is convex, hence a greedy algorithm should work well.",
    "Let us take the gradient of this expression. We get\n$$\\nabla_w \\mathcal{L}(w) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} x_n [g(y_n) - x_n g'(\\mathbf{x}_n^\\top w)],$$\nwhere we used the fact that\n$$\\nabla A(\\eta) = g'(\\eta).$$\n\nIf we set this equation to zero we get the condition of optimality. In particular, if we rewrite this sum by using our matrix notation we get\n$$\\nabla \\mathcal{L}(w) = \\frac{1}{N} X^\\top [g^{-1} (Xw) - \\phi(y)] = 0,$$\nwhere, as before, the scalar functions $(g^{-1} \\text{ and } \\phi)$ are applied to each vector component-wise.\nTo compare, for the case of the logistic regression we got the equation\n$$\\nabla \\mathcal{L}(w) = \\frac{1}{N} X^\\top [\\sigma(Xw) - y] = 0.$$\n\nAs we have discussed, for the logistic case (Bernoulli distribution) we have the relationship $g^{-1} = \\sigma$, which confirms that our previous derivation was just a special case.\nNote also that we have already shown that \\(A(X^\\top w)\\) is a convex function of \\(X\\) and since \\(A(X^\\top w)\\) is the composition of a linear (hence in that case convex) function. Therefore \\(L(w)\\) is convex (for a linear function $\\ell$ or linear), just as we have seen this for the softmax regression. As a consequence, the desired property that the objective function is a strictly convex differentiable function is again verified in this case. We can therefore apply our previous argument expected to work well in this context.",

    "\\textbf{Basic Structure of Convolutional Nets}\n\nRecall that for standard neural network every node at level $l$ is connected to every node at level $l-1$. The advantage of this structure is that it is very general and powerful. The disadvantage is that such a network has a large number of parameters and so generally lots of data is needed to train it.\n\nIn some scenarios it is intuitive that \"local\" processing of data should suffice. E.g., consider an audio stream given by samples $x[0]$. It is natural to process such a stream by running it through a linear time-invariant filter, whose output, call it $x^1[n]$, is given by the convolution of the input $x^0[n]$ and the filter $f[n]$,\n\n$$ x^1[n] = \\sum_k f[k] x^0[n-k]. $$\n\nThe filter $f[n]$ is often \"local\", i.e., $f[k] = 0$ for $|k| \\ge K$. Much of signal processing is based on this type of operation. By choosing an appropriate type of filter we can bring out various aspects of the underlying signal. E.g., we can smooth beats by averaging, or we can enhance differences between neighboring elements by taking a so-called \"high-pass\" filter.\n\nWe have essentially the same scenario if we think of a picture. Now the signal $x^0[n,m]$ is two-dimensional and the convolution takes the form \n\n$$ x^1[n,m] = \\sum_{k,l} f[k,l] x^0[n-k, m-l]. $$",
    "As before, we can take filters $f[n, m]$ that are \u201clocal\u201d i.e., only have non-zero coefficients for small values of $|n|$ and $|m|$.\n\nThere are two important aspects about this structure. First, the output $z^{(1)}$ at position $[n, m]$ only depends on the value of the input $z^{(0)}$ at positions close to $[n, m]$. If we use this in a NN then we no longer get a fully connected network but the structure is much more sparse and local. This implies that we have significantly fewer parameters to deal with. Second, this structure implies that we should use the same filter (e.g. not only the same connection-pattern but also the same weights) at every position! This is called weight sharing. Weight sharing drastically reduces the number of parameters further.\n\nFigure 1 shows two layers of a very small NN where we see the difference between a fully connected network and one where connections are sparse and local.\nWhy is it meaningful to use the same filter at every position in the network? Consider e.g. a photo. Photos are inherently \u201cshift invariant.\u201d We can imagine that there is an essentially infinite-sized photo in reality and we are seeing only a limited portion of it. The portion we are seeing is more or less random and so the exact position of any object in this image is more or less random as well. It therefore makes sense that we treat each position essentially equally.\n\n\\textbf{Layout}\n\nIt is common to lay out the data in a convolutional network according to its \u201cnatural\u201d layout. E.g., if the input is a photo",
    "Figure 1: Sparse connections (upper illustration) versus fully connected (lower illustration). In the sparse case a node on the bottom layer only influences a limited number of nodes on the top layer. (Figure 9.2 from \\textit{http://www.deeplearningbook.org})\n\nthen it is natural to use a 2D layout, whereas if the data is naturally one-dimensional then it makes sense to use a 1D layout.\n\n\\textbf{Handling of Borders}\n\nConsider a 2D case. Assume that we have an input of dimension $N_1 \\times N_2$ and a kernel $f[l,m]$ so that $|f[m,l]| = 0$ if $\\| l \\| \\geq K_1$ or $\\| m \\| \\geq K_2$. There are several natural ways of dealing with the boundary.\n\nThe first is to \\textit{pad} the original input data with zeros at the boundary. More precisely, instead of considering the input",
    "\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{fig_dl/fig_dl_intro_11.pdf}\n\\caption{Handling the boundary using the \\textit{valid packing} method. \\textbf{(Figure 9.1 from http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)}\n\\end{figure}\n\nof size $N_1 \\times N_2$, consider the input to be of size $(N_1 + 2(K_1 - 1)) \\times (N_2 + 2(K_2 - 1))$ where the \"center piece\" is the original data and there is an additional boundary of width $K_1 - 1$ and $K_2 - 1$ respectively which is set to 0. If we now perform the convolution then the output will again be of size $N_1 \\times N_2$. For obvious reasons this is called \\textit{zero padding}.\n\nThe second option is to compute an output which is only of size $(N_1 - 2(K_1 - 1)) \\times (N_2 - 2(K_2 - 1))$, i.e., to perform the convolution only for positions so that the whole filter lies inside the original data. This is called \\textit{valid padding}. Figure 2 shows this second method.",
    "\\textbf{Multiple Channels}\n\nAssume we start with picture, i.e., a 2D structure. It is common to not only compute the output of a single filter but to use multiple filters. The various outputs are called \\textbf{channels}. This introduces some additional parameters into the model.\n\nIf we add several channels we do not end up with a 2D output in the next level but in fact with a 3D output. We proceed in the same fashion in each further stage, computing several channels per input layer in the previous stage. In this manner, we will get more and more channels as we get deeper and deeper into the network. On the other hand the \"size\" of each picture typically gets smaller and smaller as we proceed through the layers, either due to the handling of the boundary or because we might perform subsampling. The whole structure then looks a little bit like a pyramid. It gets thinner towards the top but the sections become longer and longer (more and more channels). This is shown in Figure 3.\n\n\\textbf{Training}\n\nAs we discussed, there are two aspects that make CNN special. First, only some of the edges are present. This means that the weight matrices are sparse and this does not require any change in the learning steps when we use SGD and backpropagation.\n\nSecond, weight sharing is used, i.e., many edges use weights that are the same. As we already mentioned in the previous",
    "\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{convolutional_nerve_fibers.png}\n\\caption{Structure of a typical CNN. Per layer we have increasingly more channels but a smaller \"footprint.\" (from www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-ud730)}\n\\end{figure}\n\nlecture, with a small modification the back propagation algorithm can still be used to train a CNN with weight sharing: run backpropagation ignoring that some weights are shared, considering each weight on each edge to be an independent variable. Once the gradient has been computed for this network with independent weights, sum up the gradients of all edges that share the same weight. This gives the right gradient for the network with weight sharing.\n\nTo see that this is the correct thing to do, consider a simple example. Let $f(x, y, z)$ be a function from $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. Let $g(z, y) = f(z, x, y)$. In words, $z$ is no longer an independent variable but we set $z = x$. If we now want to compute the gradient\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial g(x, y)}{\\partial x} \\quad \\frac{\\partial g(x, y)}{\\partial y} \\right)\n$$",
    "then we can compute this by first computing\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial f(x,y,z)}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f(x,y,z)}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial f(x,y,z)}{\\partial z} \\right)\n$$\nand then realizing that\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial g(x,y,z)}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial g(x,y,z)}{\\partial y} \\right) = \n\\left( \n\\frac{\\partial f(x,y,z)}{\\partial x} \\Big|_{x,y,z} \\frac{\\partial f(x,y,z)}{\\partial y} \\Big|_{x,y,z} \n\\right)\n$$\n\n\\textbf{FFT}\n\nThe convolutional structure can be used in order to compute the output of a CNN very efficiently. Whether this is more efficient than computing the output by directly implementing the sum depends on the size of the filter/kernel. \nTo keep things simple, assume that our data layout is one-dimensional and that each layer is connected via a convolution where we use zero-padding at the boundaries. Let us consider the first layer to be specific. We then have\n$$\nx^{(1)}[n] = \\sum_k f[k] x^{(0)}[n - k].\n$$\n\nAssume that $|f[k]| = 0$ for $k \\not\\in \\{0, \\dots, K - 1\\}$. I.e., the filter has at most $K$ non-zero coefficients. And assume that the signal $x^{(0)}[n]$ has length $N$. Zero-pad both the signal and the filter to match the input length $L$, where $L \\geq N + K - 1$. More precisely, for the filter the first $K$ positions are the non-zero positions of the original filter and the remaining $L - K$ are",
    "zeros. For the signal the first $N$ positions are the non-zero coefficients of the signal and the remaining $L - N$ are zeros. Call the resulting quantities $\\tilde{f}$ and $\\tilde{x}$ respectively. Compute the cyclic convolution of these two signals, i.e., compute\n\n$$\n\\tilde{z}^{(1)}[n] = \\sum_{k=0}^{L-1} f[k] \\tilde{x}[n - k \\mod L].\n$$\n\nThis convolution is just like the regular one except that we compute indices modulo $L$. A quick check shows that $\\tilde{x}^{(1)}[n]$ (where we used zero-padding to deal with the boundary) and $\\tilde{z}^{(1)} [n]$ are identical for the first $N - K + 1$ positions.\n\nBut this cyclic convolution can be computed by transforming both the signal as well as the filter into the Fourier domain, multiplying the two, and then converting the result back. This in turn can be accomplished efficiently by means of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in the $L \\log_2 L$ operations, where $\\epsilon$ is a small constant.\n\nMore precisely, for a signal $x[n]$ of length $L$ its discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) (also of length $L$) and its inverse are given by\n\n$$\n\\tilde{x}[k] = \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{n=0}^{L-1} x[n] e^{- \\frac{2 \\pi i}{L}nk};\n$$\n\n$$\nx[n] = \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{k=0}^{L-1} \\tilde{x}[k] e^{ \\frac{2 \\pi i}{L}nk}.\n$$",

    "\\section*{Motivation}\nModels can be \\textit{too limited} or they can be \\textit{too rich}. In the first case we cannot find a function that is a good fit for the data in our model. We then say that we \\textbf{underfit}. In the second case we have such a rich model family that we do not just fit the underlying function but we in fact fit the noise in the data as well. We then talk about an \\textbf{overfit}. Both of these phenomena are undesirable. This discussion is made more difficult since all we have is data and so we do not know a priori what part is the underlying signal and what part is noise.\n\n\\section*{Underfitting with Linear Models}\nIt is easy to see that linear models might underfit. Consider a scalar case as shown in the figure below.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{fig1.eps}\nM=80 \\\\\n\\end{center}\n\nThe solid curve is the underlying function and the circles are the actual data.

    "the noise. The noise might be due for example to some\nmeasurement inaccuracies. The $y_n$ are shown as blue circles.\nIf our model family consists of only linear functions of the\nscalar input $x$, i.e., $\\mathcal{F} = \\{f_w(x) = wx \\}$, where $w$ is a scalar\nconstant (the slope of the function), then it is clear that\nwe cannot match the given function accurately, regardless\nhow many samples we get and how small the noise is. We\ntherefore will underfit.\n\n\\textbf{Extended/Augmented Feature Vectors} From the above\nexample it might seem that linear models are too simple to\never befit. But in fact, linear models are highly prone to\noverfitting, much more so than complicated models like neu-\nral nets.\nSince linear models are inherently not very rich the following\nis a standard ``trick'' to make them more powerful.\nIn order to increase the representational power of linear mod-\nels we typically ``augment'' the input. E.g., if the input (fea-\nture) is one-dimensional we might add a polynomial basis (of\narbitrary degree $M$),\n\n$$\n\\phi(x_n) = [1, x_n, x_n^2, x_n^3, \\ldots, x_n^M]\n$$\n\nso that we end up with an extended feature vector.\nWe then fit a linear model to this extended feature vector\n$\\phi(x_n)$:\n$$\ny_n \\approx w_0 + w_1 x_n + w_2 x_n^2 + \\ldots + w_M x_n^M \\equiv \\phi(x_n)^\\top \\mathbf{w}.\n$$",

    "Why is this the case? Assume that a genie tells you the $L_1$-norm of the optimum solution. Draw the $L_1$-ball with that norm value (think of 2D to visualize it). So now you know that the optimal point is somewhere on the surface of this \u201cball\u201d. Further you know that there are ellipsoids, all with the same mean and rotation that describes the equal error surfaces insured by the first term. The optimum solution is where the \u201csmallest\u201d of these ellipsoids just touches the $L_1$-ball. Due to the geometry of this ball this touch is likely to be on one of the \u201ccorner\u201d points.

This is a quadratic form. Let $A = X^TX$. Note that $A$ is a symmetric matrix and by assumption it has full rank. If $A$ is a diagonal matrix with strictly positive elements $a_i$ along the diagonal then this describes the equation\n$$\n\\sum_i a_i w_i^2 = \\alpha,\n$$\nwhich is indeed the equation for an ellipsoid. In the general case, $A$ can be written as (using the SVD) $A = UBU^T$, where $B$ is a diagonal matrix with strictly positive entries. This then corresponds to an ellipsoid with rotated axes. If we now look at \n$$\na = ||y \u2212 Xw||^2,\n$$\nwhere $y$ is in the column space of $X$ then we can write it as $a = ||X(w \u2212 w_0)||^2 = ||Xz||^2$. We now do so and this corresponds to a shifted ellipsoid. The key point here is that $Xy_1 = (X(w_0 \u2212 w)) = y_{L_1}$, where $y_{L_1}$ is the component of $y$ that lies in the subspace spanned by the columns of $X$ and $y_{\\perp}$ is the component that",

In order to compute the posterior we use Bayes law and we assume that the components of the weight vector are i.i.d Gaussians with mean zero and variance $\\sigma_W^2$:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{w}_{MAP} &= \\arg \\min_\\mathbf{w} \\, - \\log p(\\mathbf{w} | \\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{y}) \\\\\n&= \\arg \\min_\\mathbf{w} \\, - \\log \\frac{p(\\mathbf{y} | \\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{w}) p(\\mathbf{w})}{p(\\mathbf{y} | \\mathbf{X})} \\\\\n&= \\arg \\min_\\mathbf{w} \\, - \\log p(\\mathbf{y} | \\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{w}) p(\\mathbf{w}) \\\\\n&= \\arg \\min_\\mathbf{w} \\, - \\log p(\\mathbf{y} | \\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{w}) \\, - \\log p(\\mathbf{w}) \\\\\n&= \\arg \\min_\\mathbf{w} \\, - \\log \\left( \\prod_{n=1}^N p(y_n | \\mathbf{x}_n, w) \\right) \\, - \\log p(\\mathbf{w}) \\\\\n&= \\arg \\min_\\mathbf{w} \\, - \\sum_{n=1}^N \\log \\mathcal{N} \\left( y_n | \\mathbf{x}_n^T \\mathbf{w}, \\sigma_z^2 \\right) \\, - \\log \\mathcal{N} (\\mathbf{w} | \\mathbf{0}, \\sigma_w^2 \\mathbf{I}) \\\\\n&= \\arg \\min_\\mathbf{w} \\, - \\sum_{n=1}^N \\log \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma_z^2}} \\exp \\left( \\frac{-(y_n - \\mathbf{x}_n^T \\mathbf{w})^2}{2 \\sigma_z^2} \\right) \\right] - \\log \\left[ \\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma_w^2)^{D/2}} \\exp \\left( \\frac{-\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{w}}{2\\sigma_w^2} \\right) \\right] \\\\\n&= \\arg \\min_\\mathbf{w} \\, \\sum_{n=1}^N \\frac{(y_n - x_n^T \\mathbf{w})^2}{2\\sigma_z^2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{d=1}^D \\frac{w_d^2}{\\sigma_w^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nIn step (a) we used Bayes' law.

It is shown in Figure 1. Recall that we can split this network into two parts. The first part comprises the input layer and all the \\(L\\) hidden layers. The task of this part of the net is to transform the original input into a more suitable representation. In other words, this part of the net represents a function from \\(\\mathbb{R}^D\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}^K\\). The second part, represented by the final layer performs the actual ML task (regression or classification). \n\nWe will now focus on the first part. We will ask: How \"powerful\" are neural nets? More precisely, what functions \\(f(x)\\) can they represent, or better, what functions can they approximate? We will see that even relatively simple nets (with at most two hidden layers) are capable of approximating any",
    "continuous function arbitrarily closely on a bounded domain, assuming only that we allow a large number of nodes and arbitrary weights and biases.\nWe will not take a rigorous approach. Rather, we will follow the lead of Michael Nielsen and give a heuristic but rather convincing argument which shows why neural nets are so expressive.\nIf you are interested in a rigorous approach we recommend that you read either \u201cApproximation by superposition of a sigmoidal function\u201d by Cybenko (1989), or \u201cUniversal approximation bounds for superpositions of a sigmoidal function\u201d by Barron (1993). Both of these papers deal with networks with a single layer and sigmoids as approximation functions. Since then, many further approximation results for various network structures, activation functions, and approximation measures have been derived.\nBefore we get into our heuristic argument let us state the main theorem of the paper by Barron. This gives you a flavor of what kind of results can be proved.",
    "Lemma. Let $f : \\mathbb{R}^D \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a function such that\n\\[\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^D} |\\omega| |\\hat{f}(\\omega)| d\\omega \\leq C,\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n\\hat{f}(\\omega) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^D} f(x) e^{-j \\omega \\cdot x} dx\n\\]\nis the Fourier transform of $f(x)$. Then for all $n \\ge 1$, there exists a function $f_n$ of the form\n\\[\nf_n(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^n c_j \\varphi(\\mathbf{w}_j \\cdot \\mathbf{x} + b_j) + c_0,\n\\]\ni.e., a function that is representable by a NN with one hidden layer with n nodes and \"sigmoid-like\" activation functions so that\n\\[\n\\| f(x) - f_n(x)\\|^2_{L^2} dx \\leq \\frac{(2C \\pi)^2}{n}.\n\\]\n\nDiscussion: First note that the condition on the Fourier transform is a \"smoothness condition.\" E.g., functions so that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^D} |\\omega| |\\hat{f}(\\omega)| d\\omega < \\infty $ can be shown to be continuously differentiable.\n\nSecond note that the lemma only guarantees a good approximation in a bounded domain. The larger the domain, the more nodes we need in order to approximate a function to the same level (see the exponential term in function in the ball where we want the approximation to be good, in the upper bound).",
    "Third, this is an approximation \"in average\", more precisely in $L_2$-norm. We will mostly discuss approximations in this sense but come back to this point at the end.\n\nFourth, the approximation $f_n$ with $n$ terms corresponds exactly to our model of a neural net with one hidden layer containing $n$ nodes and sigmoids as activation functions.\n\nFifth, the theorem applies to all activation functions that \u201csigmoid-like,\u201d i.e., all activation functions whose left limit is 0, whose right limit is 1, and that are sufficiently smooth. \n\nIn words the lemma says that a sufficiently \u201csmooth\u201d function can be approximated by a neural net with one hidden layer and the approximation error goes down like one over the number of nodes in the hidden layer. Note that this is a very fast convergence.\n\n\\textbf{Approximation in Average}\n\nWe will now give a very simple and intuitive explanation why neural nets with a sigmoid as activation function and at most two hidden layers have already a large expressive power. This explanation will not be rigorous and it will fall far short of the stated lemma by Barron which proves that we need only one hidden layer and not too many hidden nodes. We will search for an approximation \u201cin average\u201d i.e., an approximation so that the integral over the absolute value of the difference is arbitrarily small.",
    "Figure 2: A lower and an upper Riemann sum.\n\n\\textbf{Functions \\(\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\)}\n\nWe start with a scalar function \\( f(x) \\) on a bounded domain. Recall that if this function is continuous then it is Riemann integrable, i.e., it can be approximated arbitrarily closely by \u201cupper\u201d and \u201clower\u201d sums of rectangles, see Figure 2. Of course, we might need a lot of such rectangles to approximate the area with an error of at most \\(\\epsilon\\), but for every \\(\\epsilon > 0\\) we can find such an approximation. \n\nWe will now show that if we do not limit the weights, then with two hidden nodes of a neural network with one hidden layer we can construct a function which is arbitrarily close to a given rectangle. But since, as we have just seen, a finite number of rectangles suffices to approximate a bounded continuous function arbitrarily closely, it follows that with finite number of hidden nodes of a neural network with one hidden layer we can approximate any such function arbitrarily closely (in the sense that the integral of the absolute value-",
    "\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{sigmoid.png}\n\\caption{The sigmoid function.}\n\\end{figure}\n\nof their difference is arbitrarily small). \n\nThe following idea is taken from the tutorial by Michael Nielsen, http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com. \n\nLet $\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$ be the sigmoid function. We have encountered it already in the last lecture. But here it is again in Figure 3. \n\nConsider the function $f(x) = \\phi(wx - b)$, where $w$ is the weight of a particular edge and $-wb$ is the bias term. \n\nNote that if $w \\ge 0$ then $f(x)$ is an increasing function that increases smoothly from 0 to 1. Further, the \u201ctransition\u201d happens at the spot $x = b$, i.e., at this value of $x$ the function has the value $\\frac{1}{2}$. The transition is the faster the larger we choose the weight $w$. In fact, if we set $b = 0$ so that the transition from 0 to 1 happens at $x = 0$, then the derivative of the function at 0 is $w/4$. In other words, the width of the transition is of order $4/w$. \n\nTherefore, if we want to create a rectangle that jumps from 0 to 1 at $x = a$ and jumps back to 0 at $x = b$, $a < b$, then ",
    "Figure 4: An approximate rectangle of the form $\\phi(w(x-a)) - \\phi(w(x-b))$ with $w = 10, 20, and 50$, respectively.\n\nFigure 5: A simple NN implementation of equation (1).\n\nwe can accomplish this by taking\n\\[\n\\phi(w(x-a)) - \\phi(w(x-b)),\n\\]\nand taking $w$ to be very large. This is shown in Figure 4 where the three figures correspond to $w = 10, 20$ and $50$, respectively and $a = -3$ and $b = 5$. We see that for large values of $w$ the result is barely distinguishable from a true rectangle.\n\nNote that equation (1) has a very simple representation in form of a neural net. This is shown in Figure 5. There is one input node which contains the value $x$. This value is",
    "multiplied by some large weight (in the figure it is 50) and it is then forwarded to the two hidden nodes. One of these hidden nodes has a bias of 150 the other one has a bias of $-250$, so that the sums at these two hidden nodes are $50(x+3)$ and $50(x-5)$, respectively. Each node applies the sigmoid function and forwards the result to the output layer. The edge from the top hidden node to the output has weight 1 and the one from the bottom hidden node to the output has weight $-1$. The output node adds the two values. The result is $\\sigma(50(x+3)) - \\sigma(50(x-5))$, which is approximately a unit-height rectangle from $-3$ to 5. If we want a rectangle of height $h$, use the weights $h$ and $-h$ in the second layer instead of the weights 1 and $-1$.\n\nIt is hopefully clear at this point why any continuous function on a bounded domain can be approximated via a neural network with one hidden layer. Let us summarize in telegram style: Take the function. Approximate it by the Riemann sense. Approximate each of the rectangles in the Riemann sum by means of two nodes in the hidden layer of a neural net. Compute the sum (with appropriate sign) of all the hidden layers at the output node. If we are using a Riemann sum with $K$ rectangles we get therefore a neural network with thresholds in the hidden layer containing $2K$ nodes.\n\nA few remarks are in order:\n\n1. The same intuition applies to many activation functions. All we have used is that the activation function has left limit 0 and right limit 1, just like for Barron's result.\n\n2. Whereas Barron's result gave us a strong bound on ",
    "the number of required nodes, our intuitive explanation gave us no bound.\n\n3. The above approximation only works if we allow the weights to become arbitrarily large. Of course, very large weights would likely cause problems in practice. It is also not clear why we should need them. There is no fundamental reason why we should first approximate rectangles very precisely which then in turn approximate a continuous function.\n\n\\textbf{Functions} $\\mathbb{R}^D \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$\n\nSo far we have talked about a real function of a single variable. What about functions over $\\mathbb{R}^D$? We will see that the same principle applies but we will need one more layer. The extra idea that is needed to extend the above scheme from one to several dimensions was already present in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. We will therefore stick to this case. You should have no trouble figuring out how to extend it to $\\mathbb{R}^D$.\n\nAs before, it will suffice if we can show how to approximate any two-dimensional rectangle. In fact, all we need here are two-dimensional rectangles that are parallel to the two axes. \n\nLet the two inputs/axes be $x_1$ and $x_2$, represented by two nodes in the input layer. Assume that we want to represent a rectangle of height 1 that extends from $a_1$ to $b_1$, $a_1 < b_1$, on the $x_1$ axis and from $a_2$ to $b_2$, $a_2 < b_2$, on the $x_2$ axis. Consider the two figures in Figure 1. The first is a rectangle that goes from 0 to $b_1$ in the direction of the $x_1$ axis but is unbounded in the $x_2$ direction. The function it represents is",
    "Figure 6: A 2-D rectangle bounded in one dimension and unbounded in the other.\n\nshown Figure 7.\n\nLet us add to this rectangle another one that is unbounded in the $x_3$ direction but extends from $a_2$ to $b_2$ in the direction of the $x_2$ axis. The corresponding neural net is shown in Figure 8 and the plot of the corresponding function is shown in Figure 9. This is close to what we want. In the region where we want the function to be 1 it is in fact close to 2 since we have there the sum of two functions, each of height 1. A trivial scaling by a factor 1/2 would bring it to the desired value in this region. But unfortunately we still have in addition the two \u201carms\u201d that extend to infinity along each axis. Those have height 1.\n\nBut those additional unwanted \u201carms\u201d are easily suppressed. Just apply the sigmoid function with some large weight and bias, let\u2019s say $y_2$, to the node that sums up the two rectangles. A plot of the resulting function is shown in Figure 10. So instead of being the output node, as it was before, this",

We can approximate any sufficiently smooth 2-dimensional function on a bounded domain by using a suitable number of those and adding them at the output\nnode.\n\\section*{Point-wise Approximations and other Activation Functions}\n\nSo far we have considered approximations \u201cin average\u201d. I.e., we have seen for Barron\u2019s result that the $L_2$ norm can be made arbitrarily small. And for our intuitive derivation we took the Riemann integral as a starting point, i.e., we considered the $L_1$ norm.\nWe can also ask if a point-wise approximation with vanishing",

Further, we have limited our discussion so far to \"sigmoid-type\" activation functions, i.e., activation functions whose left limit is 0 and whose right limit is 1.\n\nSo let us now look at point-wise approximations with an activation function that is the rectified linear function,\n\n$$(x)_{+} = \\max \\{0, x\\}.$$\n\nMany other combinations (approximation criterion and activation function) are of course possible and have been considered.\n\nLet $f(x)$ be a continuous function on a bounded domain. Without loss of generality we can assume that this domain is $[0, 1]$, rescaling and shifting the x-axis if necessary. The classical Stone-Weierstrass theorem says that for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a polynomial $p(x)$ so that for all $x \\in [0,1]$,\n\n$$|f(x) - p(x)| < \\epsilon.$$",

    "term can also be represented by a node in the hidden layer with activation function $(x)_{+}$ by choosing $x_{0} = 0$, since we only need this representation to be correct in the range $[0, 1]$.

    "\\textbf{Classification}\n\nSimilar to regression, \\textcolor{blue}{classification} relates the input variable $\\mathbf{x}$ to the output variable $y$, but now $y$ can only take on discrete values. We say that $y$ is a categorical variable.\n\n\\textbf{Binary classification}\n\nWhen $y$ can only take on two values, it is called \\textcolor{blue}{binary classification}. Sometimes we refer to the two discrete values abstractly as $y \\in \\{ C_1, C_2 \\}$. The $C_i$ are called class labels or simply \\textcolor{blue}{classes}. Other times it is more conveniently to assume that $y \\in \\{ +1, -1 \\}$ or $y \\in \\{ 0, 1 \\}$. Note that, unless the class labels are real values, there is typically no ordering implied between the two classes.\n\n\\textbf{Multi-class classification}\n\nIn a \\textcolor{blue}{multi-class classification}, $y$ can take on more than two values, i.e., $y \\in \\{ C_0, C_1, \\ldots, C_{K-1} \\}$ for a $K$-class problem. Again, even though there is in general no ordering among these classes, we sometimes use the labels $y \\in \\{ 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, K-1 \\}$.\n\n\\textbf{Examples of classification problems}\n\nA credit card service must be able to determine whether or not a requested transaction is fraudulent. They might have at their disposal the users IP address (if the transaction",
    "happens on the web), past transaction history, and perhaps some other features.\n\nAn example from the book \\textit{Elements of Statistical Learning} by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman is shown below. We have at our disposal the annual incomes and monthly credit card balances of a number of individuals. The individuals who defaulted on their credit card payments are shown in orange, and those who did not are shown in blue.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics{scatterplot.png}\n\\end{center}\n\nTo consider another example, a person arrives at the emergency room with a set of symptoms that could possibly be attributed to one of three medical conditions. Which of the three conditions does the individual have?\n\n\\section*{Classifier}\nA \\textbf{classifier} will divide the input space into a collection of regions belonging to each class. The boundaries of these re-",
    "gions are called \\textit{decision boundaries}. A classifier can be \\textit{linear} or \\textit{nonlinear}. This distinction is less strict than it might seem at first. E.g., if you look at the classifier in the right-hand side of \\textit{Figure 4.1} you will see that the decision regions are non-linear (not straight lines). But in fact the classifier that led to these region is linear - we added some non-linear features to the original feature vector (think polynomial bases) before performing the linear classification. The decision boundaries appear non-linear since the plot is made in the original feature space and not the extended feature space.\n\n\\textbf{What is the aim of classification?}\n\nIn some situations we are interested in classification in itself. This means, we are constructing a predictor based on a training set and are interested in applying this predictor to \"new\" data. Consider e.g. the example of the credit card company that wants to predict if a customer will default or not.\n\nBut in some instances we are interested in more. We would like to \"understand\" the cause. Think e.g. of a stock prediction. Not only are we interested to know if a stock will go up but we would like to understand \\textit{why} the stock moves. It so we are interested in the \"interpretation\" of the predictor. In order to focus on this task it is important to have simple models and for that reason we sometimes skip attributes that do not contribute significantly to the prediction.\nConsider \\textit{Figure 4.1}. In this data certain risk factors are given for a particular heart disease. These risk factors are blood pressure (sbp), tobacco usage, family history, obesity,",

It is a special case since the output is restricted to a small discrete set. So it might appear that there is not much new and that we should simply apply our",
    "standard regression techniques to this special case.\n\nE.g., we can assign $y = 0$ for $C_1$ and $y = 1$ for $C_2$ and, given a training set $S_{train}$, we can use (regularized) least-squares to learn a prediction function $f_{\\text{lsma}}$ for this regression problem. To convert the regression into a classification it is then natural to decide on class $C_1$ if $f_{\\text{lsma}}(x) < 0.5$ and $C_2$ if $f_{\\text{lsma}}(x) > 0.5$.\n\nIn the figure below this approach is applied to the credit-card default problem. To keep things simple we use a feature called the balance (as we have seen in a previous plot the second feature the income does not contain much information). We think of $y = 0$ as \"no default\" and $y = 1$ as \"default\". The dots we see correspond to the various data points where all dots are either on the line $y = 0$ or $y = 1$. The horizontal axis corresponds to the input $x$, the balance.\n\nIn the figure the output $y$ is labeled as probability. This is just a convenient way of interpreting things. Since the desired label $y$ is either 0 or 1 we can think of $y$ as the probability of a default.\n\nSo let us now run a regression on the training data $S_{train}$. To keep things simple we run a linear regression and learn the linear function $f_{\\text{lsma}}(x)$. The result is the blue curve that the indicated.\n\nWe might want to interpret the value $f_{\\text{lsma}}(x)$ as the probability of a default and then assign a label depending on whether this \"probability\" is smaller or larger than 0.5. Of course, this \"probability\" can be negative or be larger than 1 so such an interpretation has to be taken with a grain of salt.",
    "\\begin{figure}[H]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.6\\textwidth]{img.png}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\textbf{Why classification is not just a special case of regression}\n\nIt is not hard to see that this method can lead to questionable results. Even if the cases and controls are well separated, the general \u2018\u2018position\u2019\u2019 of the line will depend crucially on how many points are in each class and where these points lie. E.g., if we add a few points with $y=1$ and a very large balance this will shift the curve significantly even though only a few points changed. This is clearly not a desirable feature.\n\nWhy does this happen? The squared loss function that we used for regression is not a good match to our objective. We would like that the \\textit{fraction of misclassified cases} is small. But the mean-squared error is only very loosely related to this objective. In particular, the mean-squared error counts positive and negative deviations from the class label equally bad, although only one of them can potentially lead to a misclassification. If we do have a very small mean-squared error then indeed we can guarantee a small classification error.\n",
    "but the opposite is not true\u2014a regression function can have  \narbitrarily large mean-squared error even though the fraction  \nof misclassified cases is arbitrarily small. We therefore might  \nhave to work \u201cmuch harder\u201d than we should in bringing down the mean-squared error and so to have a guarantee on the misclassification error.  \nBased on the above observation, we see that classification is not just a special form of regression with a simple loss function like the mean-squared error.\n\n\\textbf{Some basic ideas of how to perform classification}\n\nMany different approaches have been developed over the years of how to efficiently perform classification. Our aim right now is not to give an exhaustive account of all possible techniques. Rather, let us quickly discuss some basic ideas. We will come back and discuss those in more detail in later lectures.\n\n\\textbf{Nearest Neighbor}\n\nIn some cases it is reasonable to postulate that inputs that \nare \u201cclose\u201d are also likely to have the same label attached. \nHere \u201cclose\u201d might e.g. be measured by the Euclidean distance \n$|x-x'|$. If we believe that this assumption is good, then, given \nan input $x$ and a training set $S_{train}$, we can look for that point $x'$, which is closest to $x$ and an element of $S_{train}$ and then output $y'$, the label attached to $x'$.\n",
    "The good point about such a classifier is that it might work well even in cases where the decision boundaries are very irregular (see the Figure 2.3 below). But, as we will discuss in a later lecture, such a scheme fails miserably in high dimensions since in this case the geometry renders the notion of \"close by\" meaningless.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{knn_decision_boundary.png}\n\\caption{FIGURE 2.3. The same classification example as in Figure 1.1. The decision boundaries and the predictions obtained using the k-nearest-neighbor classifiers.}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThere are many natural generalizations of this concept. Instead of using a single neighbor we can use lets say the $k$ nearest neighbors or we can take a weighted linear combination of elements in our neighborhood. The latter idea leads to smoothing kernels.\n\n\\textbf{Linear decision boundaries}\n\nOne starting point is to assume that decision boundaries are linear (hyperplanes). Consider e.g. a binary classification problem and look at schemes where the boundary between",
    "the two classes is a hyperplane. We can ask how to pick this boundary. To keep things simple, assume that there exists a \u201cseparating hyperplane\u201d i.e., a hyperplane so that no point in the training set is misclassified.\nIn general, there might be many hyperplanes that do the trick (assuming there is at least one). So which one should we pick?\nOne idea is to pick a hyperplane so that the decision has as much \u201crobustness/margin\u201d with respect to the training set as is possible. I.e., if we slightly change the training set by \u201cwiggling\u201d the inputs we would like that the number of misclassifications stays low.\nIn the figure below (taken from Wikipedia) we see that $H_1$ does not separate the data, but $H_2$ and $H_3$ do. Between $H_2$ and $H_3$, $H_3$ is preferable, since it has a larger \u201cmargin.\u201d This idea will lead us to \\textbf{support vector machines} (SVM) as well as \\textbf{logistic regression}.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{svm_margin.png}\n\\end{array}\n$$",
    "\\textbf{Non-linear decision boundaries}\n\nIn many cases linear decision boundaries will not allow us to separate the data and non-linearities are needed. One option is to augment the feature vector with some non-linear functions. (The \\textit{kernel trick} is a method of doing this in an efficient way. We will learn about this at a later stage.) Another way is to find an appropriate non-linear transform of the input so that the transformed input is then linearly separable. This is what is done when we are using \\textit{neural networks}.\n\n\\textbf{Optimal classification for known generating model}\n\nIt is instructive to think about how one could classify in an \\textit{optimal} fashion, i.e., how one could minimize the probability of misclassification, if the distribution of the generating model was known. To be concrete, assume that we know the joint distribution\n$$\np(x, y)\n$$\nand that $y$ takes on elements in a discrete set $\\mathcal{Y}$.\nGiven the \u201cobservation\u201d (input $x$), let $g(x)$ be our estimate of the class label. What is the optimum choice for this function? Note that our estimate is only a function of the input $x$. Further, for a given input $x$, the probability of the \u201ccorrect\u201d label is $p(y | x)$, according to our model. So if our estimate is $g(x)$ then we will be correct with fraction $p(g(x) | x)$ of the time. We conclude that if we want to maximize the probability of guessing the correct label then we should choose",
    "the decision rule\n\n\\[ \\hat{y}(x) = \\arg \\max_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}} p(y \\mid x) \\]\n\nThis is called the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) criterion since we maximize the posterior probability (it is called posterior probability, since it is the probability of a class label after we have observed the input $\\mathbf{x}$). This classifier is also called the Bayes classifier. \nThe probability of a correct guess is then the average (over all inputs $\\mathbf{x}$) of this probability, i.e.,\n\n\\[ \\Pr\\{ \\hat{y}(\\mathbf{x}) = y \\} = \\int p(\\mathbf{x}) p(\\hat{y} (\\mathbf{x}) = y \\mid \\mathbf{x}) d \\mathbf{x} . \\]\n\nIn practice we do not know the joint distribution $p(\\mathbf{x}, y)$. But we could use such an approach by using the data itself to learn the distribution (perhaps by assuming that the distribution is Gaussian and then just fitting the parameters from the data).",

    "\\textbf{Logistic regression}\n\nRecall that in the previous lecture we discussed what happens if we treat binary classification as regression with lets say $y = 0$ and $y = 1$ as the two possible (target) values and then decide on the label by looking if the predicted value is smaller or larger than 0.5.\n\nWe have also discussed that it is tempting to interpret the predicted value as probability. \n\nBut there are problems: (i) the predicted values are in general not in $[0, 1]$; further, (ii) very large ($y \\gg 0$) or very small ($y \\ll 0$) values of the prediction will contribute to the error if we use the squared loss, even though they indicate that we are very confident in the resulting classification.\n\nIt is therefore natural that we transform the predictions that take values in $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ into a true probability by applying an appropriate function. There are several possible such functions. The \\textit{logistic function} \n\n$$\\sigma(z) := \\frac{e^z}{1 + e^z}$$\n\nis a natural and popular choice, see the next figure.\\footnote{If you implement this function note that you are applying the exponential function to potentially large (in magnitude) values.}\n",

We proceed as follows. Given a training set $S_{train}$ we learn a weight vector $\\mathbf{w}$ (we will discuss how to do this shortly) and a \"shift\" (scalar) $w_0$. Given a \"new\" feature vector $\\mathbf{x}$, we predict the (posterior) probability of the two class labels given $\\mathbf{x}$ by means of\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item $p(1 \\mid \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{w}) = \\sigma(\\mathbf{x}^T \\mathbf{w} + w_0),$\n  \\item $p(0 \\mid \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{w}) = 1 - \\sigma(\\mathbf{x}^T \\mathbf{w} + w_0).$\n\\end{itemize}\n\nNote that we predict a real value (a probability) and not a label. This is the reason it is called logistic regression. But typically we use logistic regression as the first step of a classifier. In the second step we quantize the value to a binary value, typically according to whether the predicted probability...\n\n\\footnote{This causes numerical issues. One work around is to implement this function by first deflecting the value of x and by treating large (in magnitude) values separately.}",

More precisely, this is a case with two fea- \ntures and hence two weights that we learn. We \nsee the effect of changing the weight vector on the \nresulting probability function. \nIt is easy to see what the roles of $w$ and $w_0$ are. The \nvector $w$ is orthogonal to the \"surface of transition\" \nand the $w_0$ allows us to shift the transition point \nalong the vector $w$. E.g., if $w = (1, 0)$ and $w_0 = 0$ \nthen the transition between the two levels happens \nat the $x_1 = 0$ plane. By scaling $w$ we can make the \ntransition faster or slower and by changing $w_0$ we \ncan shift the decision region along the $w$ vector.",
    "\\includegraphics{logistic_regression.jpg}\n\nAt this point it is hopefully clear how we use logistic regression to do classification. To repeat, given the weight vector $\\mathbf{w}$ we predict the probability of the class label 1 to be $p(1 \\mid \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{w}) = \\sigma (\\mathbf{x}^T \\mathbf{w} + w_0)$ and then quantize. What we need to discuss next is how we learn the model, i.e., how we find a good weight vector $\\mathbf{w}$ given some training set $S_\\text{train}$.\n\n\\textbf{A word about notation}\n\nIn the beginning of this course we started with an arbitrary feature vector $\\mathbf{x}$. We then discussed that often it is useful to add the constant 1 to this feature vector and we called the resulting vector $\\mathbf{\\tilde{x}}$. We also discussed that often it is useful to add further features and we called then the resulting vec-",
    "tor $\\phi(x)$. Note that in particular for the logistic regression it is crucial that we have the constant term contained in x since this allows us to \"shift\" the decision region.\n\n\\textit{We will assume from now on that the vector x always contains the constant term as well as any further features we care to add. This will save us from a flood of notation.}\nHence, from now on we no longer need the extra term $w_0$ but the term $x^\\top w$ suffices since it contains already the constant.\n\n\\textbf{Training}\n\nAs always we assume that we have our training set $S_{\\text{train}}$ consisting of iid samples $\\{(x_n, y_n)\\}_{n=1}^N$ sampled according to a fixed but unknown distribution D.\nExploiting that the samples $(x_n, y_n)$ are independent, the probability of $\\mathbf{y}$ (vector of all labels) given $\\mathbf{X}$ (matrix of all inputs) and $\\mathbf{w}$ (weight vector) has a",
    "simple product form:\n\n\\[ p(y \\mid \\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{w}) = \\prod_{n=1}^{N} p(y_n \\mid \\mathbf{x}_n) \\]\n\n\\[\n= \\prod_{n=1}^{N} p(y_n = 1 \\mid \\mathbf{x}_n)^{y_n} \\cdot p(y_n = 0 \\mid \\mathbf{x}_n)^{1-y_n}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\prod_{n=1}^{N} \\sigma(\\mathbf{x}_n, \\mathbf{w})^{y_n} [1 - \\sigma(\\mathbf{x}_n, \\mathbf{w})]^{1-y_n}\n\\]\n\nIt is convenient to take the logarithm of this probability to bring it into an even simpler form. In addition we add a minus sign to the expression. In this way our objective will be to minimize the resulting cost function (rather than maximizing it). This is consistent with our previous examples, where we always minimized the cost function. We call the resulting cost function $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w})$,\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w}) = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} [ y_n \\ln \\sigma(\\mathbf{x}_n, \\mathbf{w}) + (1 - y_n) \\ln [1 - \\sigma(\\mathbf{x}_n, \\mathbf{w})]]\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} [ \\ln[1 + \\exp(\\mathbf{x}_n, \\mathbf{w})] - y_n \\mathbf{x}_n, \\mathbf{w}]\n\\]\n\nIn the last step we have used the specific form of the logistic function $\\sigma(x)$ to bring the cost function into a nice form.",
    "Before we continue note the following. In principle we should have written down the likelihood of the data $(\\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{X})$ given the parameter $\\mathbf{w}$, i.e.,\n$$\np(\\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{X} |\\mathbf{w}).\n$$\nBut\n$$\np(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{X}|\\mathbf{w}) = p(\\mathbf{X}|\\mathbf{w})p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{w}) = p(\\mathbf{X})p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{w}),\n$$\nwhere in the second step we have made the natural assumption that the $\\mathbf{X}$ data does not depend on the parameter we choose in our model. Note that this is an assumption and part of our model. But now note that the factor $p(\\mathbf{X})$ is a constant w.r.t the choice of $\\mathbf{w}$, and hence plays no role when we apply the maximum likelihood criterion.\n\n\\textbf{Maximum likelihood criterion}\n\nRecall what we did so far. Under the assumption that the samples are independent we have written down the likelihood of the data given a particular choice of weights $\\mathbf{w}$. We then choose the weights $\\mathbf{w}$ that maximize this likelihood. Equivalently, we choose the weights that maximize the \\textit{log-likelihood}. This is called the \\textit{maximum-likelihood criterion}. In a final refinement, we added a negative sign to bring the cost function to our standard form and called it $\\mathbf{L}(\\mathbf{w})$. In this form,",
    "we are looking for the weights $\\mathbf{w}$ that minimize $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w})$. In formulae, we choose the weight $\\mathbf{w}^\\star$, so that\n$$\\mathbf{w}^\\star = \\arg \\min_\\mathbf{w} \\, \\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w}).$$\n\nAs we discussed in that context of the probabilistic interpretation of the least squares problem, one justification of the maximum-likelihood criterion is that, under some mild technical conditions, it is consistent. i.e., if we assume that the data was generated according to a model in this class and we have i.i.d. samples and we use this procedure to estimate the underlying parameter, then our estimate will converge to the true parameter if we get more and more data. Of course, in practice the data is unlikely being generated in this way and there might not be any probabilistic model underlying it. But nevertheless, this gives our method a theoretical justification.\n\n\\textbf{Conditions of optimality}\n\nAs we want to minimize $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w})$, let us look at the stationary points of this function by computing the gradient, setting it to zero, and solving for $\\mathbf{w}$. Note",
    "that\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\ln[1 + \\exp(x)]}{\\partial x} = \\sigma(x).\n\\]\n\nTherefore\n\\[\n\\nabla \\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w}) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\mathbf{x}_n \\left( \\sigma(\\mathbf{x}_n^\\top \\mathbf{w}) - y_n \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{N} \\mathbf{X}^\\top \\left[ \\sigma(\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w}) - \\mathbf{y} \\right].\n\\]\n\nRecall that by our convention the matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ has $N$ rows, one per input sample. Further, $\\mathbf{y}$ is the column vector of length $N$ which represents the $N$ labels corresponding to each sample.\nTherefore, $\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w}$ is a column vector of length $N$. The expression $\\sigma(\\mathbf{Xw})$ means that we apply the function $\\sigma$ to each of the $N$ components of $\\mathbf{Xw}$. In this manner we can express the gradient in a compact manner.\nThere is no closed-form solution for this equation. Let us therefore discuss how to solve this equation in an iterative fashion by using gradient descent or the Newton method.\n\n\\textbf{Convexity}\n\nSince we are planning to iteratively minimize our cost function, it is good to know that this cost func-",
    "Lemma. The cost function\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w}) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\ln[1+ \\exp(\\mathbf{x}_n^T \\mathbf{w})] - y_n \\mathbf{x}_n^T \\mathbf{w}\n$$\n\nis convex in the weight vector $\\mathbf{w}$.\n\n\\textit{Proof.} Recall that the sum (with non-negative weights) of any number of (strictly) convex functions is (strictly) convex. Note that $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w})$ is the sum of $2N$ functions. $N$ of them have the form $-y_n \\mathbf{x}_n^T \\mathbf{w}$, i.e., they are linear in $\\mathbf{w}$ and a linear function is convex. Therefore it suffices to show that the other $N$ functions are convex as well. Let us consider one of those. It has the form $\\log[1 + \\exp(\\mathbf{x}_n^T \\mathbf{w})]$. Note that $\\ln(1 + \\exp(z))$ is convex. It has first derivative $\\sigma(z)$ and second derivative\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\ln(1+\\exp(x))}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma(x)}{\\partial x} = \\sigma(x)(1-\\sigma(x)), \\eqno{(1)}\n$$\n\nwhich is non-negative.\n\nThe proof is complete by noting that $\\ln[1 + \\exp(\\mathbf{x}_n^T \\mathbf{w})]$ is the composition of a linear function with a convex function, and is therefore convex.\n\n\\textit{Note.} Alternatively, to prove that a function is convex (strictly convex) we can check that the Hessian",
    "(matrix consisting of second derivatives) is positive semi-definite (positive definite). We will do this shortly.\n\n\\textbf{Gradient descent}\n\nAs we have done for other cost functions, we can apply a (stochastic) gradient descent algorithm to minimize our cost function. E.g., for the batch version we can implement the update equation \n\n\\[ w^{(t+1)} := w^{(t)} - \\gamma^{(t)} \\nabla \\mathcal{C}(w^{(t)}), \\]\n\nwhere $\\gamma^{(t)} > 0$ is the step size and $w^{(t)}$ is the sequence of weight vectors.\n\n\\textbf{Newton's method}\n\nThe gradient method is a \\emph{first-order} method, i.e., it only uses the gradient (the first derivative). We get a more powerful optimization algorithm if we also use the second order terms. Of course there is a trade-off. On the one hand we need fewer steps to converge if we use second order terms, on the other hand every iteration is more costly. Let us describe now a scheme that also makes use of second order terms. It is called \\emph{Newton's method}.",
    "Hessian of the Log-Likelihood\n\nLet us compute the Hessian of the cost function $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w})$, call it $\\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{w})$. What is the Hessian? If $\\mathbf{w}$ has $D$ components then this is the $D \\times D$ symmetric matrix with entries\n$$ H_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w})}{\\partial w_i \\partial w_j}. $$\n\nRecall that the cost function $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w})$ is a sum of $N$ terms, all of the same form. So let us first compute the Hessian corresponding to one such term. We already computed the gradient of one such term and got\n$$ x_n (\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}_n^T \\mathbf{w}) - y_n). $$\n\nRecall, that this gradient is a vector of length $D$ (the dimension of the feature vector $\\mathbf{x}$ and hence also the dimension of the weight vector) where the i-th component is the derivative of $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w})$ with respect to $w_i$. If you look at the above expression you see that this gradient is equal to $\\mathbf{x}$ (a vector) times the scalar $(\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}_n^T \\mathbf{w}) - y_n)$. Note that x does not depend on $\\mathbf{w}$ and neither does $y_n$. The only dependence on $\\mathbf{w}$ is in the term $\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}_n^T \\mathbf{w})$. Therefore, the Hessian associated to the term will be\n$$ \\mathbf{x}_n (\\nabla \\sigma (\\mathbf{x}_n^T \\mathbf{w}))^T. $$",
    "We have already seen that $\\sigma'(x) = \\sigma(x)(1 - \\sigma(x))$. Therefore, by the chain rule one such term gives rise to the Hessian\n$$\nx_i x_i^T \\sigma'(x_i w)(1 - \\sigma^T (x_i w)).\n$$\nIt remains to do the sum over all $N$ samples. Rather than just summing, let us put this again in a compact form by using the data matrix $X$. We get\n$$\nH(w) = \\frac{1}{N} X^T S X,\n$$\nwhere $S$ is a $N \\times N$ diagonal matrix with diagonal entries\n$$\nS_{nn} := \\sigma(x_n w)[1 - \\sigma(x_n w)].\n$$\nNote that the diagonal entries of $S$ are non-negative. Hence $H(w)$ is non-negative definite. This gives us an alternative proof that our original cost function is convex.\n\n\\textbf{Newton's Method}\n\nGradient descent uses only first-order information and takes steps in the direction opposite to the gradient. This makes sense since the gradient points in the direction of increasing function values and we want to minimize the function.",
    "\\textit{Newton's method} uses second-order information and takes steps in the direction that minimizes a quadratic approximation. More precisely, it approximates the function locally by a quadratic form and then moves in the direction where this quadratic form has its minimum. The update equation is of the form\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{w}^{(t+1)} = \\mathbf{w}^{(t)} - \\gamma^{(t)} (\\mathbf{H}^{(t)})^{-1} \\nabla \\mathcal{L} (\\mathbf{w}^{(t)}).\n\\]\n\nWhere does this update equation come from?

Assume that we take the right-hand side to be an exact representation of our cost function. We want to minimize this function. So let us place ourselves where the right-hand side takes its minimum value. If we think that this approximation is reasonably good, then it makes sense to move the new weight vector to the position of this minimum.\n\nLet us take the gradient of the right hand side and",
    "set it to zero. We get\n$$ \\nabla \\mathcal{L}(w^*) + \\mathbf{H}(w^*)(\\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{w}^*) = 0. $$\n\nSolving for $\\mathbf{w}$ gives us $\\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{w}^* - \\mathbf{H}(w^*)^{-1}\\nabla \\mathcal{L}(w^*)$. This corresponds exactly to the stated update equation, except that in this update we have an extra step size $\\gamma$. Why do we need this factor?\n\nRecall that the right-hand side is only an approximation. Caution therefore dictates that we only move part of the way to the indicated minimum.\n\n\\textbf{Regularized Logistic Regression}\n\nAlthough the cost-function for logistic regression is lower bounded by 0 we get issues if the data is linearly separable. In this case there is no finite weight vector $\\mathbf{w}$ which gives us this minimum cost function and if we continue to run the algorithm the weights will tend to infinity.\n\nTo avoid this problem, as for standard regression problems, we can add a penalty term.

    "\\section*{Motivation}\n\nIn our last lecture we formulated the optimization problem corresponding to SVMs. We then derived an alternative formulation using duality. We saw that in this alternative formulation the data only enters in the form of a \"kernel\" \n\\[ \\mathbf{K} = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{X}^T. \\]\n\nThe aim of today is the following. First, we will discuss a second problem, namely ridge regression, that admits an alternative formulation that is \"kernelized,\" i.e., the alternative formulation depends on data only via the kernel \n\\[ \\mathbf{K} = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{X}^T. \\]\nSecond, we will see that for any kernelized problem we can apply the kernel trick. This trick will allow us to use a significantly augmented feature vector without incurring extra costs. We will discuss what kernel functions are admissible for this trick and how to construct new kernel functions from old ones.\n\nEven though we present the kernel trick in the context of ridge regression it will hopefully be clear by the end that the same trick can be applied to any problem that can be brought into kernelized form.\n\n\\section*{Alternative formulation of ridge regression}\n\nRecall that ridge regression corresponds to the following optimization problem: \n\\[\n\\min_{\\mathbf{w}} \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} \\|\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w}\\|^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\|\\mathbf{w}\\|^2.\n\\]\nIt has the solution \n\\[\n\\mathbf{w}^* = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X} + \\mathbf{I}_D \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}.\n\\]\n",
    "We claim that this solution can be written alternatively as\n$$\n\\mathbf{w}^* = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\mathbf{X}^\\top (\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{X}^\\top + \\lambda \\mathbf{I}_N)^{-1} \\mathbf{y}. \\tag{1}\n$$\nThis second formulation can be proved using the following identity: let $\\mathbf{P}$ be an $N \\times M$ matrix and $\\mathbf{Q}$ be an $M \\times N$ matrix. Then, trivially,\n$$\n\\mathbf{P} (\\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{P} + \\mathbf{I}_M) = \\mathbf{P} \\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{P} + \\mathbf{P} = (\\mathbf{P} \\mathbf{Q} + \\mathbf{I}_N) \\mathbf{P}.\n$$\nIf we now assume that $(\\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{P} + \\mathbf{I}_M)$ and $(\\mathbf{P} \\mathbf{Q} + \\mathbf{I}_N)$ are invertible we have the identity\n$$\n(\\mathbf{P} \\mathbf{Q} + \\mathbf{I}_N)^{-1} \\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{P} (\\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{P} + \\mathbf{I}_M)^{-1}.\n$$\nTo derive from this general statement our alternative representation, let $\\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{X}^\\top$ and $\\mathbf{Q} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\mathbf{X}$.  \nWhy is this alternative representation useful?\n\n1. Define $\\mathbf{ \\alpha} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{X}^\\top + \\lambda \\mathbf{I}_N)^{-1} \\mathbf{y}$.

    "\\textbf{The kernel trick}\n\nThe big advantage of using kernels is that rather than first augmenting the feature space and then computing the kernel, we can do both steps together, and we can do it more efficiently. Let us discuss how this works.\n\nLet us define a \u201ckernel function\u201d $\\kappa(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}')$ and let us compute the $(i,j)$-th entry of $\\mathbf{K}$ as $K_{ij} = \\kappa(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j)$.

In other words, for the right choices we have\n$$\n\\kappa(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}') = \\phi(\\mathbf{x})^\\top \\phi(\\mathbf{x}').\n$$\nThis is probably best seen by looking at examples:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item To start trivially, if we pick the linear kernel $\\kappa(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}') = \\mathbf{x}^\\top \\mathbf{x}'$, then the corresponding feature map is of course $\\phi(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}$.\n    \n    \\item Assume that $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, i.e. $x$ is a scalar.

    "4. The kernel\n\n\\[ \\kappa (x,x') = \\exp \\left[ -(x - x')^{\\top}(x - x') \\right] \\]\n\ncorresponds to an infinite feature map! It is called the \\textit{radial basis function} (RBF) kernel. In order to look at this more in detail, consider the simple case where the $x$ and $x'$ are scalars. In this case we have the expansion\n\n\\[ K(x,x') = e^{-(x - x')^{2}} = e^{-x^{2}} e^{-x'^{2}} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^{k} (xx')^{k}}{k!} \\]\n\nWe see that we can think of this as the inner product of infinite-dimensional vectors whose $k$-th component, $k=0, 1, \\dots$ is equal to\n\n\\[ e^{-x^{2}} \\frac{2^{k/2} x^{k}}{\\sqrt{k!}} \\]\nand\n\\[ e^{-x'^{2}} \\frac{2^{k/2} {x'}^{k}}{\\sqrt{k!}} \\]\n\nrespectively. And although this is not obvious, let us state that this kernel cannot be represented as an inner product in a finite-dimensional space.\n\n5.

Clearly, $\\phi(\\mathbf{x}) = f(\\mathbf{x})$ will be the corresponding feature map.\n\n\\textbf{Classifying with the kernel K}\n\nWe have seen so far how we can compute the optimal parameter vector $\\alpha$ using only the kernel (and not having to go to the extended feature space). We have also discussed that in some cases the feature space is in fact infinite. All this would not be useful if there was no also a way to do the prediction using only the kernel. Indeed this is possible. Recall that the classifier predicts $y = \\phi(\\mathbf{x})^\\top \\mathbf{w}$ which, using (2), can be expressed as\n\n\\[\ny = \\phi(\\mathbf{x})^\\top \\hat{\\mathbf{O}}(\\mathbf{X})^\\top \\alpha = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\kappa(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}_n) \\alpha_n.\n\\]\n\nI.e., we can express the prediction in terms of the kernel function applied to the new feature vector and the data vector in the original space and do not need to go into the augmented space. From this expression we can also clearly see that although the classifier in the extended space $\\phi(\\mathbf{x})$ is linear, yet at the decision regions in the original space $\\mathbf{x}$ it is not linear.\n\n\\textbf{Properties of kernels: Mercer\u2019s Condition}\n\nA natural question is the following: how can we ensure that there exists a $\\phi$ corresponding to a given kernel function $\\kappa$?",
    "I.e., how do we ensure that the kernel function is an inner-\u0003\nproduct in some feature space?\nMercer\u2019s condition states that this is true if and only if the\nfollowing two conditions are fulfilled.

For an ML model where this does not hold, think for example of a neural network (more details later).",
    "\\textbf{Matrix multiplication}\n\nTo go any further, one must revise matrix multiplication.

Is it possible to find such a line?\n\nThis problem is related to something called $D > N$ problem (in statistics typically named $p > n$). It means that the number of parameters exceeds number of data examples. In other words, we have more variables than we have data information. For many models, such as linear regression, this makes the task \\emph{under-determined}.

How does the gradient descent algorithm change when using this form of regularization?\\footnote{This discussion is not restricted to neural nets but applies generally. We just happen to discuss this topic in the context of neural nets.} Assume that we use the same constant in all layers, i.e. $\\mu^{(l)} = \\mu$.

More subtle, we can use the PCA and \u201ccompress\u201d the image by only keeping the components corresponding to the largest singular values.

Typical values are $P_i^{(0)} = 0.8$ (i.e., we keep in expectation 80 percent of all input nodes) and $P_i^{(l)} = 0.5$ for $l \\geq 1$, (i.e., we keep in expectation 50 percent of all hidden nodes).\n\nAt every training step decide for each node $i$ at level $l$ according to the probability $P_i^{(l)}$ whether to keep this node or not. This defines a \u201csubnetwork.\u201d Run one step of SGD (or perhaps a minibatch) and update the weights. Iterate until training is done.\n\nFor the prediction phase several variants are possible. Either generate $K$ subnetworks in the same manner as before; predict for each and average the prediction. Alternatively we could work however not for the prediction. But in this case scale the weights that lead a level $l$ by the factor $P_i^{(l)}$. This guarantees that the expected input at each node stays the same as the expected input during training.\n\nThere are two benefits to this \u201cdropout\u201d procedure. First,\n",
    "it has been observed that this procedure limits overfitting. Intuitively, nodes cannot \"rely\" on other nodes being present. Second, note that there is an exponential number of \"sub-networks.\" This is shown in Figure 5 for a very small network. The effect of dropout is that we are performing an average over several (sub)networks. We either do this explicitly by running over several of them, computing the output, and then average. Or we do this implicitly by using the whole network but with reduced weights. We therefore get the advantage that comes with model averaging. Averaging over many models is a standard ML trick and it is called \\textit{bagging}. It typically leads to improved performance. But dropout is quite different from standard bagging since we do not train $K$ networks and then average. Rather, all these networks share the same weights. In fact, this characteristic seems to be an important component to explain their good performance.\n\nIn dropout we remove whole nodes. It is of course also possible to remove individual edges independently from each other.",

    "\\section*{Motivation}\n\nLast time we saw how to assess if a given function was good. In particular, we discussed how we can bound the difference between the true risk of the function and the empirical risk. We then used the same ideas and discussed how to choose the \"best\" out of a finite number of models. This led to the idea of splitting the data into a \\textit{train set} and a \\textit{test set}. Our motivation for the model selection problem was that typically we need to optimize hyper-parameters. E.g., in the ridge regression problem the hyper-parameter was $\\lambda$. These hyper-parameters often control the \"complexity\" of the class of models that we allow.\n\nToday we will focus on how the risk (true or empirical) behaves as a function of the complexity of the model class. This will lead to the important concept of the \\textbf{bias - variance} trade-off when we perform the model selection. It will help us to decide how \"complex\" or \"rich\" we should make our model.\n\nLet us discuss a very simple example. Consider linear regression with a one-dimensional input and using polynomial feature expansion. The maximum degree $d$ regulates the complexity of the class. We will see that the following is typically true: \n\\\\\n\\textbf{Assume that we only allow simple models, i.e., we restrain the degree to be small:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item We then typically will get a large bias, i.e., a bad fit.\n\\item On the other hand the variance of $L_D(f)$ as a function of the random sample $S$ is typically small.\n\\end{itemize}",
    "We say that we have high bias but low variance.  \n\\textit{Assume that we allow complex models, i.e., we allow large degrees:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item We then typically will find a model that fits the data very well. We will say that we have small bias.\n    \\item But we likely observe that the variance of $L_D(fs)$ as a function of the random sample $S$ is large.\n\\end{itemize}\nWe say that we have low bias but high variance.\n\n\\textbf{Data Generation Model}\n\nAssume that the data is generated as  \n\\[ y = f(x) + \\epsilon, \\]\nwhere $f$ is some (arbitrary and unknown) function and $\\epsilon$ is additive noise with distribution $\\mathcal{D}$, that is independent from sample to sample and independent from the data. Assume the noise has zero mean (otherwise this constant can be absorbed into $f$). Note that $f$ is in general not realizable, i.e., it is in general not in our model class.  \nWe further assume that $x$ is generated according to some fixed but unknown distribution $\\mathcal{D}_x$. Finally, we assume that the loss function $\\ell(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is the square loss. Let $D$ denote the joint distribution on pairs $(x, y)$.\n\n\\textbf{Error Decomposition}\n\nAs always, we have given some training data $S_{\\text{train}}$, consisting of i.i.d. samples according to $D$. Given our learning",
    "algorithm $\\mathcal{A}$, we compute the prediction function $f_{S_{\\text{train}}} = \n\\mathcal{A}(S_{\\text{train}})$. We are ultimately interested in how the true error\n\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{D}}[(f(\\mathbf{x}) + \\epsilon - f_{S_{\\text{train}}}(\\mathbf{x}))^2]\n\\]\n\nbehaves as a function of the training set $S_{\\text{train}}$ and the com\\-plexity of the model class.\nBut the decomposition we will discuss already applies \u201cpoint\\-wise\u201d, i.e., for a single sample $\\mathbf{x}$. It is therefore simpler if we fix $\\mathbf{x}_0$, and only consider\n\n\\[\n(f(\\mathbf{x}_0) + \\epsilon - f_{S_{\\text{train}}}(\\mathbf{x}_0))^2.\n\\]\n\nWe imagine that we are running the experiment many times: we create $S_{\\text{train}}$, we learn the model $f_{S_{\\text{train}}}$, and then we eval\\-uate the performance by computing the square loss for this fixed element $\\mathbf{x}_0$. \nSo let us look at the expected value of this quantity:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}_{S_{\\text{train}} \\sim \\mathcal{D}^m}[\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{D}}[(f(\\mathbf{x}_0) + \\epsilon - f_{S_{\\text{train}}}(\\mathbf{x}_0))^2]].\n\\]\n\nWe will now show that we can rewrite the above quantity as a sum of three non-negative terms and this decomposition",
    "has a natural interpretation. We write\n\n\\begin{align}\n(E_{S_{train} \\sim \\mathcal{D} \\sim \\mathcal{D}} [(f(x_0) + \\epsilon - f_{S_{train}} (x_0))^2] \\\\\n\\ (a) = E_{\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{D}_{\\epsilon}} [\\epsilon^2] + E_{S_{train} \\sim \\mathcal{D}} [(f(x_0) - f_{S_{train}} (x_0))^2] \\\\\n\\ (b) = \\mathop{Var}_{\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{D}_{\\epsilon}} [\\epsilon] + E_{S_{train} \\sim \\mathcal{D}} [(f(x_0) - f_{S_{train}} (x_0))^2] \\\\\n\\ (c) = \\mathop{Var}_{\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{D}_{\\epsilon}} [\\epsilon] \\text{\\ tiny (noise variance)} \\\\\n\\ + (f(x_0) - E_{S_{train} \\sim \\mathcal{D}} [f_{S_{train}} (x_0)])^2 \\text{\\ tiny (bias)} \\\\\n\\ + E_{S_{train} \\sim \\mathcal{D}} [(E_{S'_{train} \\sim \\mathcal{D}} [f_{S'_{train}} (x_0)] - f_{S_{train}} (x_0))^2]. \\text{\\ tiny (variance)}\n\\end{align}\n\nNote that here $S'_{train}$ is a second training set, also sampled from $\\mathcal{D}$ that is independent of the training set $S_{train}$.",
    "\\textsc{\\textbf{Details:}}\\\\\nIn step (a), we omitted the third term\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}_{S_{\\text{train}} \\sim \\mathcal{D} \\sim \\mathcal{D}_{L}} [2 \\epsilon ( f(\\mathbf{x}_0) - f_{ S_{\\text{train}}} (\\mathbf{x}_0) )].\n\\]\nBut since the noise $\\epsilon$ is independent from $S_{\\text{train}}$ we can first average over the noise, and by observing that the noise has mean zero, we see that this term is in fact zero.\\\\\nFurther, since the noise has zero mean, the second moment is equal to the variance. This explains step (b).\\\\\nIn step (c) we have added and subtracted the constant term $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{D}}[ f_{ S_{\\text{train}} } (\\mathbf{x}_0) ]$ to the expression and then expanded the square.\\\\\nThe expansion yields the two expressions which are stated (termed ``bias\" and ``variance\"). In addition it yields the cross term (to save space we omit the factor 2 and the ``train\" subscript)\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\mathbb{E}_{S_{\\mathcal{D}}} \\Bigl[ \\bigl( f(\\mathbf{x}_0) - \\mathbb{E}_{S_{\\mathcal{D}}}[f_{S}(\\mathbf{x}_0) \\bigr) \\bigl( f_{S}(\\mathbf{x}_0) - \\mathbb{E}_{S_{\\mathcal{D}}}[f_{S}(\\mathbf{x}_0)] \\bigr) \\Bigr] & = \\mathbb{E}[f(\\mathbf{x}_0) ] - \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{D}}[f_{S_{\\mathcal{D}}}(\\mathbf{x}_0)] \\cdot \\mathbb{E}_{S_{\\mathcal{D}}}[ f_{S} (\\mathbf{x}_0) - \\mathbb{E}_{S_{\\mathcal{D}}} [f_{S} (\\mathbf{x}_0)]] \\\\\n    & = (f(\\mathbf{x}_0) - \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{D}} [f_{S_{\\text{train}}}(\\mathbf{x}_0)] ) \\cdot \\mathbb{E}_{S_{\\mathcal{D}}}[ f_{S} (\\mathbf{x}_0) - \\mathbb{E}_{S_{\\mathcal{D}}}[f_{S} (\\mathbf{x}_0)]] \\\\\n    & = (f(\\mathbf{x}_0) - \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{D}} [ f _{S_{\\mathcal{D}}} (\\mathbf{x}_0) ] ) \\cdot 0 \\\\\n    & = 0.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]",
    "\\textbf{Interpretation of Decomposition}\n\nEach of the three terms is non-negative. Hence each of them is a lower bound on the true error for the input $\\mathbf{x}_0$. The noise imposes a strict lower bound on what error we can achieve. This contribution is given by the term $\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathbf{x}_0, \\varepsilon}[\\varepsilon]$. The bias term is the square of the difference between the actual value $f(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ and the expected prediction $\\mathbb{E}_{S, \\varepsilon}[f_S(\\mathbf{x}_0)]$, where the expectation is over the training sets. (E.g., simple models can not fit well, so have a large bias) The variance term is the variance of the prediction function. If we consider very complicated models then small variations in the data set can produce vastly different models and our prediction for an input $\\mathbf{x}_0$ will vary widely.\n\n\\textbf{Examples}\n\nThe following four figures are taken from the book by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani (Introduction to Statistical Learning). The first three pictures show three different functions each (the true function is the black curve). The first function is called medium \"complexity\", the second is very simple, and the third is the most complicated. In each case, three different predictions are done based on models of increasing complexity.",

As mentioned, this can cause the gradient to become very small, sometimes making learning slow.\n\n\\textbf{Rectified linear Unit \u2013 ReLU}\n\nVery popular is the rectified linear unit (ReLU) $r_{x}$ that we have also seen already. To recall, it is defined by\n\n$$\n{r_{x}} = \\max \\{ 0, x \\},\n$$\n\nand a plot is shown in Figure 3. Note that the ReLU is  \n",

One nice property of the ReLU is that its derivative is 1 (and does not vanish) for positive values of $x$ (it has 0 derivative for negative values of $x$ though).\n\n\\section*{Leaky ReLU}\nIn order to solve the 0-derivative problem of the ReLU (for negative values of $x$) one can add a very small slope $\\alpha$ in the negative part. This gives rise to the leaky rectified linear unit (LReLU). It is defined by\n$$f(x) = \\max \\{ \\alpha x, x \\}$$\nand a plot is shown in Figure 4. The constant $\\alpha$ is of course a hyper-parameter that can be optimized.\n\n\\section*{Maxout}\nThe maxout generalizes ReLU and LReLU.

    "\\section*{Some GAN variants with Lipschitz Discriminator}\n\n\\textit{(optional material)}\n\nThe constraint that the discriminator should be 1-Lipschitz can be enforced in several ways. The table below summarizes some of the GAN variants which enforce such constraint.\n\n\\textbf{WGAN} \\cite{Arjovsky et al., 2017} uses straightforward weight clipping. \\cite{Gulrajani et al., 2017} point out that this may lead to optimization difficulties, and proposed adding an extra penalty term to the training loss of the Discriminator, which penalizes gradients whose norm is higher than 1. As enforcing this for any input is intractable, they propose to consider a finite set of points whose average gradient is considered in the loss during testing. \\cite{Kodali et al., 2017} propose, instead, to choose points whose norm is tighter than 1 while considering samples in a region around real data points. Note that \\textbf{DRAGAN \\& WGAN-GP} can be understood as two sides of the same coin: \\textbf{DRAGAN} attempts to ensure that gradients are not smaller than 1 (as the loss includes gradient penalty).  \\cite{Miyato et al., 2018} added yet another way to achieve the 1-Lipschitz constraint by applying a sample based 1-norm to the Jacobian of the discriminator output w.r.t. its input. This in turn requires GANs to approximate the eigenvalues of the Jacobian. Since the Jacobian is not very high in terms of singular value, it can be implemented efficiently due to the fact that it converges faster. Another implementation method is to combine spectral norm and weight normalization in the loss itself. For instance, if the output features from a convolution is generated through different parameters in the primary model, combining weight normalization of the largest singular value, has empirically shown sufficient constraint enforcement w.r.t. the 1-Lipschitz/10-Lipschitz constraint (though, not always, as indicated below with the mix of std of eigenvectors). Note that besides WGAN-GP, DRAGAN and the use of Spectral norms, one of the very first methods for GAN loss besides hinge/loss/bounded backprop. could be provided with adversarial/uncertainty reduction optimizations (e.g., lower confidence/kernel machine/crf loss).\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n$\\textbf{Method}$ & $\\textbf{D (or) G/D}$ & $\\textbf{Means of reducing Lipschitzness}$ \\\\\n\\hline\nWGAN \\cite{Arjovsky 2017} & D & Weight clipping \\\\\nWGAN-GP \\cite{Gulrajani 2017} & D & Gradient penalty on random data points \\\\\nDRAGAN \\cite{Kodali 2018} & D & Gradient penalty on Data + Noise \\\\\northReg \\cite{Brock 2018} & G & Orthogonal normalization of the weights \\\\\nSN-GAN \\cite{Miyato 2018} & D & Spectral norm with large singular measure \\\\\nLS-GAN \\cite{Mao 2018} & GD & Spectral norm using hinge loss with improvement \\\\\nSNGAN-Block GAN \\cite{Brock 2018} & GD & Spectral norm using block norm measure\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}",

    "Figure 1: A neural network with one input layer, $L$ hidden layers, and one output layer.\n\n\\textbf{Motivation}\n\nRecall the structure of a neural network. For your convenience it is shown again in Figure 1. Assume that our task is regression. I.e., we have a training set $S_t = \\{(x_n, y_n)\\}$. Let $f(x)$ be the function that is represented by the nn (including the last layer). I.e., $f(x)$ is the output of the nn. \nLet us assume that we use our standard cost function\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} (y_n - f(x_n))^2.\n\\]\n\nWe might want to add a regularization term to avoid over-fitting, but this term is trivial to compute and to take into account. Therefore, we omit such a regularization term from our discussion in this lecture.",
    "Given our training set $S_t$, our task is to train the network to minimize the cost function. \\textit{Training} here means choosing the parameters of the net, namely the \\textit{weights} of the edges and the \\textit{bias} terms in order to minimize the cost function. Our go-to technique for training models is stochastic gradient descent. We have seen how it works for simple linear regression models but also for the matrix factorization problem. It is also a natural candidate for training neural nets and the current state-of-the-art. Contrary to some of the optimization problems we encountered this problem is not convex. In fact, we expect it to have many local minima. We therefore have no guarantee that gradient descent will get close to an optimal solution for the training set.\n\nIn addition, we have to worry about overfitting. Here the news is better: SGD is known to be \\textit{stable} when applied to a NN. Informally this means that the outcome of running SGD will not differ dramatically if we replace a single sample from our training set. More precisely, assume that we run two versions of SGD on the same net and with the same training set, except a single sample that differs in the two training sets.\n\nAssume now that the net is initialized in the same state and that we make the same random choices in the two parallel versions. Then, as long as we do not run for too many rounds, (running through the whole data set a custom number of times is OK) the outcome of the two runs will differ only slightly. And, as a consequence, such a stable training algorithm is guaranteed not to overfit, i.e., the training error will be close to the true error.",
    "As always when dealing with gradient descent we compute\nthe gradient of the cost function for a particular input sample\n(with respect to all weights of the net and all bias terms) and\nthen we take a small step in the direction opposite to this\ngradient.\n\nAs we will see, computing the derivative with respect a par-\nticular parameter amounts to applying the \\textit{chain rule of\ncalculus} and is therefore familiar to all of us. So why discuss\nthis matter?\n\nSince in general there are many parameters it would not\nbe efficient to do this computation for each parameter indi-\nvidually. We therefore will discuss how to compute all the\nderivatives \\textit{jointly} in an efficient manner. The algorithm for\ndoing so is very natural and it is called \\textit{back propagation}.\n\n\\textbf{Compact Description of Output}\n\nLet us start by writing down the output as a function of the\ninput explicitly in compact form. It is natural and convenient\nto describe the function that is implemented by each layer of\nthe network separately at first. The overall function is then\nthe composition of these functions.\nLet $\\mathbf{W}^{(l)}$ denote the weight matrix that connects layer $l - 1$\nto layer $l$. The matrix $\\mathbf{W}^{(l)}$ is of dimension $D \\times K$, the\nmatrices $\\mathbf{W}^{(l)}, ~ 2 \\le l \\le L,$ are of dimension $K \\times K$, and the\nmatrix $\\mathbf{W}^{(L+1)}$ is of dimension $K \\times 1$. The entries of each\nmatrix are given by\n$$\n{\\mathbf{W}^{(l)}}_{ij} = w_{ij}^{(l)}.\n$$",
    "where we recall that $w_{ij}^{(l)}$ is the weight on the edge that connects node $i$ on layer $l - 1$ to node $j$ on layer $l$.\n\nFurther, let us introduce the bias vectors $b^{(l)}, 1 \\leq l \\leq L+1$, that collect all the bias terms. All these vectors are of length $K_l$ except the term $b^{(L+1)}$ that is a scalar.\n\nWith this notation we can describe the function that is implemented by each layer in the form\n\n$$\nx^{(l)} = f^{(l)}(x^{(l-1)}) = \\phi(W^{(l)} x^{(l-1)} + b^{(l)}), \\qquad (1)\n$$\n\nwhere the (generic) activation function is applied pointwise to the vector.\n\nThe overall function $y = f(x^{(0)})$ can thus be written in terms of these functions as the composition\n\n$$\nf(x^{(0)}) = f^{(L+1)} \\circ \\ldots \\circ f^{(2)} \\circ f^{(1)}(x^{(0)}).\n$$\n\n\\textbf{Cost Function}\n\nThe cost function can be written as\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\left( y_n - f^{(L+1)} \\circ \\ldots \\circ f^{(2)} \\circ f^{(1)}(x_n) \\right)^2.\n$$\n\nNote that this cost function is a function of all weight matrices and bias vectors and that it is a composition of all the functions describing the transformation at each layer.\n\nNote also that the specific form of the loss (squared loss, hinge loss, ...) does not really matter for the workings of the back propagation algorithm. The most widely used and hence specific we stick to the square loss. Only the initialization of the back recursion changes if we pick a different loss function.",
    "\\textbf{The Backpropagation Algorithm}\n\nIn SGD we compute the gradient of this function with respect to one single sample. Therefore, we start with the function\n\n\\[ L_n = (y_n - f(L+1) \\circ \\cdots \\circ f(2) \\circ f(1)(x_n))^2. \\]\n\nRecall that our aim is to compute \n\\[ \\frac{\\partial L_n}{\\partial u_i^{(l)}}, \\quad i = 1, \\ldots, L + 1, \\]\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial L_n}{\\partial h_i^{(l)}}, \\quad i = 1, \\ldots, L + 1. \\]\n\nIt will be convenient to first compute two preliminary quantities. The desired derivatives are then easily expressed in terms of those quantities. \n\nLet \n\\[ z^{(l)} = (\\mathbf{W}^{(l)})^T x^{(l-1)} + b^{(l)}, \\tag{2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( x^{(0)} = x_n \\), and \\( x^{(l)} = \\phi(z^{(l)}) \\), see (1). In words, \\( z^{(l)} \\) is the input at the l-th layer before applying the activation function. These quantities are easy to compute by a \\textit{forward pass} in the network. More precisely, start with \\( x^{(0)} = x_n \\), and then apply this recursion for \\( l = 1, \\ldots, L + 1 \\), first always computing \\( z^{(l)} \\) via (2) and then computing \\( x^{(l)} = \\phi(z^{(l)}) \\). \n\nFurther, let \n\n\\[ \\delta_j^{(l)} = \\frac{\\partial L_n}{\\partial z_j^{(l)}}. \\]",
    "Let $\\delta^{(l)}$ be the corresponding vector at level l. Whereas the quantities $z^{(l)}$ were easily computed by a forward pass, the quantities $\\delta^{(l)}$ are easily computed by a backwards pass:\n\n\\[\n\\delta_j^{(l)} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial z_j^{(l)}} = \\sum_k \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial z_k^{(l+1)}} \\frac{\\partial z_k^{(l+1)}}{\\partial z_j^{(l)}} = \\sum_k \\delta_k^{(l+1)} w_{kj}^{(l)} \\phi'(z_j^{(l)}).\n\\]\n\nIn vector form we can write this as\n\n\\[\n\\delta^{(l)} = (W^{(l+1)})^T \\delta^{(l+1)} \\odot \\phi'(z^{(l)}),\n\\]\n\nwhere $\\odot$ denotes the Hadamard product (the pointwise multiplication of vectors).  \nNow that we have both $z^{(l)}$ and $\\delta^{(l)}$ let us get back to our initial goal. Note that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_{ij}^{(l)}} = \\sum_k \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial z_k^{(l+1)}} \\frac{\\partial z_k^{(l+1)}}{\\partial w_{ij}^{(l)}} = \\sum_k \\delta_k^{(l+1)} \\frac{\\partial z_k^{(l+1)}}{\\partial w_{ij}^{(l)}} = \\delta_i^{(l+1)} a_j^{(l)}.\n\\]\n\nWhy could we drop the sum in the above expression? When we change the weight $w_{ij}^{(l)}$ then it only changes the sum $\\sum_j^{(l)}$.  \nAll other sums at level l stay unchanged.  \nIn a similar manner,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial b_j^{(l)}} = \\sum_k \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial z_k^{(l+1)}} \\frac{\\partial z_k^{(l+1)}}{\\partial b_j^{(l)}} = \\delta_j^{(l)}.\n\\]",
    "\\textbf{Summary of Backpropagation Algorithm for Computing the Derivatives}\n\nWe are given a nn with $L$ hidden layers. All weight matrices $\\mathbf{W}^{(l)}$ and bias vectors $\\mathbf{b}^{(l)}$, $l = 1, \\ldots, L + 1$, are fixed. We are given in addition a sample $(x_1, y_n)$. We want to compute the derivatives\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}_n}{\\partial w_{ij}^{(l)}}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}_n}{\\partial b_{i}^{(l)}} \\quad l = 1, \\ldots, L + 1,\n$$\nwhere\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_n = (y_n - f^{(L+1)} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f^{(2)} \\circ f^{(1)}(x_n))^2.\n$$\n\n\\textbf{Forward Pass:} Set $x^{(0)} = x_n$. Compute for $l = 1, \\ldots, L + 1$,\n$$\nz^{(l)} = (\\mathbf{W}^{(l)})^T x^{(l-1)} + \\mathbf{b}^{(l)}, \\quad \\text{with} \\quad x^{(l)} = f^{(l)}(z^{(l)}).\n$$\n\n\\textbf{Backward Pass:} Set $\\delta^{(L+1)} = -2(y_n - x^{(L+1)}) \\phi' (z^{(L+1)})$. If we are using a loss other than the squared loss, this initialization changes and this is the only change. Also note that the expression $\\phi' (.)$ refers to the derivative of the activation function used in the output layer. If we are using a different activation function in the last layer (as we often do) use the appropriate derivative at this point. Compute for $l = L, \\ldots, 1$,\n$$\n\\delta^{(l)} = (\\mathbf{W}^{(l+1)} \\delta^{(l+1)}) \\odot \\phi'(z^{(l)}).\n$$\n\n\\textbf{Final Computation:} For all parameters compute\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}_n}{\\partial w_{ij}^{(l)}} = x_i^{(l-1)} \\delta_j^{(l)}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}_n}{\\partial b_{i}^{(l)}} = \\delta_i^{(l)}.\n$$",
    "Now that we have the gradient with respect to all parameters, the SGD algorithm makes a small step in the direction opposite to the gradient, then picks a new sample $(x_n, y_n)$, and repeats.\n\nOne final note. In our next lecture we will encounter networks (convolutional neural nets) where several edges share the same weight or bias. The advantage of doing so is that the net has fewer parameters and so might be easier to train with a given amount of data. How do we proceed then. We can still compute the gradient in such scenarios using the backpropagation algorithm: Write down the network pretending that all the parameters are independent. Run the backpropagation algorithm. The gradient for a particular parameter for the model where some weights are equal is now just the sum of the gradients (of the model where weights are independent) of all the edges that share the same weight.",

    "Computer Networks \\hfill EPFL - Fall semester 2017\n\n\\section{1.1: What\u2019s the internet?}\nThe internet is a computer network that interconnects hundreds of millions of computing devices throughout the world. End systems are connected together by a network of communication links and packet switches. Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the transmission rate of a link measured in bits/second. Packets are packages of data comprised of header bytes and the actual data needing to be transmitted.\n\nA packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. The route or path a packet takes is the sequence of communication links and switches it goes through.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item End systems access the internet through \\textit{Internet Service Providers (ISPs)}. Each ISP is in itself a network of packet switches and communication links. ISPs also provide internet access to content providers who have data centers that store their websites and videos. There is a hierarchy of ISPs interconnecting through national and international operator. ISPs such as Level 3 Communications, AT\\&T and Sprint.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nEnd systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run protocols that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet. The \\textit{Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)} and the \\textit{Internet Protocol (IP)} are two of the most important protocols in the Internet. The IP protocol specifies the format of the packets and the IP addresses of the sender and receiver. The Internet protocol suite is commonly known as \\textit{TCP/IP}.\n\nAt the network\u2019s edge, end systems include users such as web surfing, instant messaging, etc. These applications are run on end systems. They employ the \\textit{client-server} model. The \\textit{client} program (browser) runs on the user's end system and the \\textit{server} program runs on the web server. Mobile end systems may also connect to the internet via a \\textit{wireless access network}.\n\nThe Internet has a \\textit{structure}: it uses the \\textit{Application Programming Interface (API)} that specifies how a program running on one end system can communicate with another program running on another end system. The API defines the structure of the messages that the programs send to each other.\n\nA \\textit{network protocol} is similar to a human protocol, except that the entities exchanging messages and taking actions are \\textit{hardware} or \\textit{software} components. All Internet activities hinge on these protocols. Protocols control everything one internet activity takes: for example, what happens when you make a request to a Web server, that is, when you type the URL of a website.\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{network-diagram.jpg}\n\\caption{}\n\\end{figure}\n\\hfill \\textit{1 of 49}",
    "Web page into your Web browser? First, your computer will send a connection request message to the Web server and wait for a reply. The Web server will eventually receive your connection request message, reading a return connection reply message. Before long, that is now OK to request the Web document, your computer then sends the name of the Web page it wants to fetch. Then the server in a GET message. Finally, the Web server returns the Web page (file) to your computer. Typically, a protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.\n\n1.2: The network edge: End-Systems\nEnd systems are also referred to as hosts because they host (that is, run) application programs such as a Web browser program. Hosts are sometimes further divided into two categories: clients and servers. Today, in addition to running on desktop and mobile PCs, smartphones, and so on, servers also run in large data centers. With the emergence of cloud computing, massive data centers that contain thousands of servers, hosts are sometimes further divided into two categories. Most of the servers reside. We review the information resides in large data centers.\n\nHow do homes connect to the internet? Today, the two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are digital subscriber line (DSL) and cable. A residence typically obtains DSL Internet access from the same local telephone company (telco) that provides its wired local phone access. Each customer\u2019s DSL modem uses the existing telephone line (twisted-pair copper wire). Fortunately, it turns out that the existing telephone line can handle both telephone calls and data simultaneously. This is accomplished through the use of frequency-division multiplexing: The data is transmitted at a high frequency, while the telephone is transmitted at a lower frequency. On the customer side, an analog modem translates the digital data to high-frequency tones for transmission over telephone wires to a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) located in the telco\u2019s local central office (CO). The analog signals from many such houses are translated back into digital format at the DSLAM. The data is then sent from the DSLAM to the Internet. Hundreds or even thousands of households connect to a single DSLAM.",
    "While DSL makes use of the teleco\u2019s existing local telephone infrastructure, cable Internet access makes use of the cable television infrastructure. Figure \\ref{fig:cable_network} shows the cable head end (a neighborhood-level junction, from which traditional cable television signals are transmitted) and cable distribution networks to reach individual houses and apartments. Each access network consists of fiber links to nodes that service multiple homes, with each node typically serving 500 to 5000 homes. Because both fiber and coaxial cable are employed in this system, it is often referred to as hybrid fiber coax (HFC). Cable Internet access uses cable modems, which divide the HFC network into two channels: downstream and upstream. Typically, each home receives attenuated RF signals downstream, and upstream traffic is sent upstream to the ISP.\n\nUnlike the DSL analogy which uses dedicated phone lines, the cable head end and cable distribution systems carry the same TV signals and Internet data. As the cable operates in a shared multipoint medium, packets traveling downstream are received by many homes, but only the target system keeps it, discarding the rest. For upstream traffic, cable modems use IEEE 802.14 protocols. Cable network protocol ensures that the nodes take turns sending packets over a shared system to avoid collision. For this reason, cable access networks are often called \u201cshared broadcast media.\u201d\n\n\\begin{equation}\nS_{avg} = S_{internet} \\left( \\frac{C}{K \\cdot U} \\right)\n\\end{equation}\n\nWhere:\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item $S_{avg}$ is the average data speed.\n  \\item $S_{internet}$ is the internet speed (100Mbps typical speed).\n  \\item $C$ is the length of the cable.\n  \\item $K$ is the number of users.\n  \\item $U$ is the utilization factor of the system.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIn universities and companies, the packet switches can often connect to Ethernet to access the Internet.\n\n1.3: The Network Core\n\nIn a network application, the end systems exchange messages with each other. Messages can contain anything that the application wants; Messages may perform a function or duty or contain a file, picture, video sequence or JPEG image. To send a message from one end system to another, the source breaks long messages into smaller chunks of data known as packets. Between source and destination, each packet travels through communication links and packet switches (for which there are two predominant types, routers and link-layer switches).",
    "Most \\textit{packet switches} use \\textit{store-and-forward} transmission at the inputs to the links. This means that the packet switches must receive the entire packet and store it in a \\textit{buffer} before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link. Switches also contain forwarding tables that store the packet meta-data and indicate whether the packet is safe to be sent.\n\nEach packet switch has multiple links attached to it. Each has its own \\textit{output buffer} which stores packets that the router is about to send into that link. If an arriving packet needs to be transmitted and it finds that the link busy with the transmission of another packet, it waits until the other packet is finished. If there are multiple packets waiting to be sent, the amount of buffer space is finite, arriving packet may find that the buffer is completely full and must wait until it becomes empty. In this case, \\textit{packet loss} will occur \u2013 this means that a packet will be dropped.\n\nThere are two types of switching: \\textit{Packet switching} where packets are treated to demand and meet minimal possible of the forwarding decision is already implemented, and it is more effective of resources but is unpredictable. It needs \\textit{congestion control}, which is its main disadvantage. The other type of switching is \\textit{Circuit switching} which is often referred to as \\textit{reservation-based switching}. The resources need to handle the traffic are reserved at the end of each session before the system. Admissions control and resource efficiency are its main properties. Compared to packet switching, management of the traffic can deliver better thoroughness and better determination.\n\nThe Internet has a number of special \\textit{routing protocols} that are used automatically by the forwarding tables. In a mobile network, for example, either external AS is imported from another region to separate it and make the shorter path red return to configure the forwarding tables in the into.\n\n\\textbf{Types of ISPs and other kinds of ISPs, Tier 1:}\n1. \\textit{Regional}, Access and few cover content providers (Web and services provide)\n2. \\textit{IXPs:} Internet Exchange Points, is formed by (IXPs). Within the same region.\n3. \\textit{Access ISPs:} End users connect their access ISPs and there higher-tier ISPs. The diagram shows how they are interconnected.\n\nThe lower-tier ISPs are referred higher-tier ISPs and their region then configure automatically under geographical regions. The lower-tier ISPs connect with end users, and the higher-tier ISP's interconnected vice versa. ISPs and higher-tier ISPs avoid routing within the same AS. Lower-tier services as references connected both for under regions and lower-tier from other ISPs where also created their own networks and directly connected into lower-tier ISPs where possible.\n\n\\includegraphics{network_diagram.png}",
    "1.4: Delay, Loss and Throughput\n\nThere are a couple different types of delay that will slow a packet from source to another. The delay that is created when a switch examines a packet's header and determines where it must be sent is called the \\textit{Processing Delay}. It's usually very short (milliseconds). While waiting to be transmitted onto a link, a packet will experience \\textit{Queuing delay}. It depends on the arrival rate at the queue (on the switch), the nature of the arriving traffic (is it burts or not) and the transmission rate of the outgoing link. If the arrival rate is bigger than the departure rate, the wait can go towards infinity (with an infinite buffer). Otherwise it depends on its size. The \\textit{queuing delay} is characterized by statistical models. When the queueing delay is actually 0, variation of queueing delay and the probability that a packet will experience it. The \\textit{transmission delay} is the amount of time it takes to actually push all of the bits of a packet into a communication link. Imagine data as rice and the network as a conveyor belt with a certain rate of flow of rice. To get all the rice on the belt as quickly as possible, it must be multiplied by the packet length divided by the transmission rate of the link. To get the rice through:\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{L}{R}\n$$\n\nFinally, after the packet has been pushed onto the link, it propagates to the next node (next rice). It takes on the propagation delay, which is the amount of time it takes to propagate a bit from one end of the link to another. It depends on the propagation speed of the link and the length of the link itself.\n\n\\textbf{Example:} \n\nImagine a line for a toll booth. Traffic is delayed because they have to go to all through the booth. They arrive at different speeds; however, to go from booth A to booth B.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Data size divided by the upload transfer time. The propagation delay is the time it takes for the packet to propagate between the toll booths.\n\\item In reality, more complicated things could happen at the booth. A car is able to charge through the slip first (Processing Delay).\n\\item And finally, transmission. Thus for large files, P does not matter. Only the slowest R is taken into account (bottleneck). \n\\end{itemize}",

Each layer, along with the layers beneath it, implements some functionality. A layered architecture allows us to address a well-defined, specific part of a large and complex system. This simplification itself is of considerable value by providing modularity, making it much easier to change the implementation of the service provided by the layer. As long as the layer provides the same service to the layer above it, and uses the same services from the layer below it, the rest of the system remains unchanged when a layer's implementation is changed.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\textwidth]{layering-diagram.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\nTo provide structure to the design of network protocols, network designers organize protocols --- and the network as a whole --- into layers. Each higher level protocol is supported by services provided by one (or more) lower level protocols. We have again indicated in the services that a layer provides in a green, and the services that a layer uses in blue. A layered architecture enables us to modify a layer relatively modularly, by (a) hiding the implementation details behind the layer's interface and by (b) using the services of the layer below it.\n\nAs a summary, we can say that layering allows one to:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Reduce design complexity: focus on assembling subsystems and organizing them as a layered hierarchy.\n    \\item Improve performance (often by encapsulating function that can be optimized separately). \n\\end{itemize}\nThis is particularly fundamental when designing a network layer while keeping acceptable performance. \n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\textwidth]{network-diagram.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\hfill 6 of 49",
    "1.6: Security\n\nTwo fundamental questions in network is how does one react to adversarial behavior and\nhow it assumes the behavior of end-users and packet switches. There are a couple security issues that can happen with networks.\n\n- Eave the eavesdropper. Tries to listen in on the communication to obtain copies of the data. Quite easy over a wireless network, and also possible if she has access to the switches (on a wired network). Wouldn't be possible on a quantum channel (can't read data without modifying it).\n\n- Injection by an intruder. Pretends to be Alice to interact an send messages from Bob. She may try to inject packets into the Internet with a false source address is known as IP spoofing, and it is one of many ways in which one user can masquerade as the sender of a packet by modifying its correct return address.\n\n- DoS, the denial of service impersonate. Makes Alice or Bob (read=switch=router) and disrupts their communication. As the name suggests, a DoS attack makes it deliberately difficult for servers or networks to respond and serve up legitimate traffic. Adversarial flooding is often used, a large number of unusual axe will be sent to bogs down the network with useless requests. This is malicious behavior internet-unfriendly as it is vulnerable to this type of attack. The broadest example is to do a dictionary attack, in one stage of this, the hacker can send a large number of guesses for login + password to the affected user. For example, worst-case password: Bandwidth flooding in which the network pipes capacity are fill up, hopes to have hit critical threshold. In this case, after login parameter, can see filling up of half-open TCP connections.\n\nMitM, Man in the Middle attack. Attacks tries to intercept data in your own network without knowing, learn about the identity of the personal data or launch DoS. Malware can also be self-installed within the device without user's knowing.\n\n2.1: Network applications\n\nA network application consists of pairs of processes that send messages to each other over a network.\n\nThe application architecture is designed by the application developer and dictates the structure of the application over the various end systems. The application developer writes programs that run on the different end systems and communicates over the network. Ex. web you have two programs, one being the browser either a client-server architecture or a peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture for its application.\n\n7 of 49",
    "Computer Networks \\hfill EPFL - Fall semester 2017\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{client_server_p2p.jpg}\n\\end{center}\n\nIn a \\textbf{client-server architecture}, there is an always-on host, called the \\textit{server}, which services requests from many other hosts, called \\textit{clients}. Clients do not directly communicate with each other. The server has a fixed, well-known address, called an \\textit{IP address}. Often in a client-server application, a single server host is incapable of keeping up with all the requests from its clients. For this reason, a \\textit{data center}, housing a large number of hosts, is often used to create a powerful virtual server. A data center can have hundreds of thousands of servers, which must be managed and maintained. Additionally, the service providers may of necessity themselves rent network bandwidth costs for sending data from their data centers.\n\nIn a \\textbf{P2P architecture}, the application exploits direct communication between pairs of intermittently connected hosts, called \\textit{peers}, which are desktops and laptops controlled by users. They connect and disconnect over time. Many of today\u2019s most popular and traffic-intensive applications are based on P2P architecture. Peers communicate without passing through a dedicated server; they are \\textit{self-scalable}.\n\nThere are many challenges for P2P: the legality of the transferred files, most residential ISPs (Internet service providers) have been deploying mechanisms that essentially hinder P2P usage. They also affect the security.\n\nA \\textbf{process} can be of two types:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Client:} typically an application such as a web browser\n    \\item \\textbf{Server:} A program that waits for requests from clients\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\textbf{Sockets} provide an interface for sending messages to and receiving messages from another process. A \\textbf{socket} is the API between the application layer and the transport layer within a host.\n\n\\textbf{Process addressing with a port number:} To receive messages, a process must have an \\textbf{identifier}. A port number besides sending messages back. For example:\n\nProcess \\#1 \\ \\ Server\nProcess \\#2 \\ \\ Client\n\n\\hfill 8 of 49",
    "Computer Networks \\hfill EPFL - Fall semester 2017\n\neach pair of communicating processes, we typically label one of the two processes as the \\textit{client} and the other process as the \\textit{server}. In P2P, the client is the one who is downloading the file.\n\nA process sends messages into, and receives messages from, the network through a software interface called a \\textit{socket}. If an IP address is a door being knocked, a socket is a person himself. A socket is the interface between the application layer and the transport layer within a host. It is also referred to as the \\textit{Application Programming Interface} (API). Whereas application and \\textit{sockets} exist, they only control the application developer; the network layer side is the choice of \\textit{transport protocol} (TCP or UDP).\n\n\\textbf{Transport layer:} have the responsibility of getting the messages to the socket of the receiving process. Therefore, it is important to take into account when choosing a transport protocol:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Data data rate:} Some do not demand that all bits get to the destination (e.g., in the video - like frames can miss, we have a loss-tolerant application - audio and image loss-tolerant: E-Mails are not, ...).\n    \\item \\textbf{Throughput:} Maybe even throughput you need for your application to work? (e.g. in voice - like 3.4 kbit/s.\n    \\item \\textbf{Time constraints, sensitive application:} (E-Mails, websites, ...).\n    \\item \\textbf{Other things:} (E-Mails, websites, ...).\n    \\item \\textbf{Order:} Sometimes, it matters that all those bits can take from one end-system to another place, while other applications: like P2P sharing?\n    \\item \\textbf{Security:} Does the application need security?...\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{./figures/socket.png}\n\\end{center}\n\nThe internet makes two transport protocols available to applications; \\textbf{UDP} and \\textbf{TCP}. Neither TCP nor UDP provide any encryption --- the data will be in the application message socket in the same data that enters over the network to the destination process. An application has to understand and implement itself end-to-end security: transport-layer chooses application.\n\nTCP has TCP sockets and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) process, those are exchanged to get into secure communication --- not end-points authentication.\n\n\\textbf{TCP} is a connection-oriented service. It has the client and server exchange transport-layer control information with each other before the application-level messages begin to flow.\n\n\\hfill 9 of 49",
    "Computer Networks \\hfill EPFL - Fall semester 2017\n\nAfter the handshaking phase, a \\textbf{TCP connection} is said to exist between the sockets of the two processes: TCP code at the server (listen) machine keeps a record with information about each active client (server) process. Both processes can send messages to each other over the connection: this is a \\textit{pipe}. When the \\textbf{pipeline} finishes sending messages, it waits for confirmation there is no more data before the server-side terminates. This technique allows TCP to deliver all data sent without error and in the proper order, thanks to the application-ordered mechanism. When this client-server interaction is taking place over TCP, the connection setup does not make an important decision\u2014should each transaction go over one TCP connection or multiple connections? Both \\textit{non-persistent connection} (short: TCP connections) requests and their corresponding responses be sent over the same (\\textbf{persistent}) TCP connection:\n$$\n\\begin{array} {ccc}\n\\text {Request } & \\text {Response} & \\text{Next request}\n\\end{array}\n$$\nso the \\textbf{UDP} is a \\textbf{transport} protocol providing \\textit{minimum services}. It is the preferred one for handshaking before the two processes start to communicate. It provides \\textit{unreliable data transfer} -- no guarantee that the message will ever reach the receiving process, just that errors are not detected.\n\nThere are many throughput or time guarantee choices when using \\textbf{UDP} or \\textbf{TCP} applications: UDP has lower throughput as it does not retransmit packets like TCP, therefore the lost packets lower the throughput. UDP is not recommended to be used for streaming, video meetings, and retrieving data from online programs, while the opposite is true for the TCP guarantee.\nAny real-world protocol defines how an application uses a transport protocol in an end-system. The unit of information (tier-per-packet) is defined end-systems, passed between each sender and receiver, to explain messages exchanged in applications. (While TCP is recommended for disseminating). \n\nWhen creating an application, you need to design the architecture (client-servant peer), the communication between different end-systems (tier-per-packet is favored over TCP in UDP), and the most appropriate transport service (\\textbf{TCPSSL} or \\textbf{UDP}). \n\nA \\textbf{URL} is an address for web objects with a \\textbf{hostname + file name} format (\\url{www.epfl.ch} is an end-system (a host), index.html is a file).\n\n\\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=6in]{image-1.png}\n\\end{center}\n\n10 of 49",
    "\\subsection*{2.2: The web and HTTP}\n\nThe web is a combination of HTTP, web browser and server processes and HTML language. The \\textbf{HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)}, the Web's application-layer protocol, is at the heart of the Web. It's implemented in two programs: a client program and a server program, executing on different end systems, talking to each other by exchanging HTTP messages.\n\nA Web page (also called a document) consists of objects. An object is simply a file (HTML file, a JPEG image, a Java applet,...) that is addressable by a single URL. Most Web pages consist of a base HTML file and several referenced objects. For example, if there are five JPEG images in that HTML file, the page has six different objects. Each in a separate URL. \n\nThe references to other objects in the page with the objects' URLs.\n  \nSuch URLs can be divided into two parts: the \\textit{hostname} of the server that houses the object and the \\textit{path name} of the object. Web servers are programs that manage Web objects. Each Web server has a unique URL. Web browsers implement the client side of HTTP (User agents) while Web servers implement the server side of HTTP (Web server). Browsers and caches process user requests for Web objects while Web servers respond to those requests for objects. \n\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{HTTP_fig.pdf}\n\n\\noindent \\textbf{HTTP uses TCP} as its underlying transport protocol (rather than running on top of UDP). The HTTP server sends requested objects within response messages over TCP connection. Each object gets transferred across one separate TCP connection. HTTP follows the \\textit{client-server} model in which the browser (client) requests the object through HTTP and the server (Web server) sends them through TCP. One important characteristic of HTTP is that it is a \\textit{stateless} protocol which means the server maintains \\underline{no information} about the clients. There are two HTTP message types: request messages (that are sent from the client to the server) and response messages (from server to client).\n\nA typical HTTP request message: \n\\begin{verbatim}\nGET /somedir/page.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.some_school.edu\nConnection: close\nUser-agent: Mozilla/5.0\nAccept-language: fr\n\\end{verbatim}\n\n\\noindent A typical HTTP response message: \n\n\\begin{verbatim}\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nDate: Sun, 14 Oct 2018 23:39:00 GMT\nServer: Apache/2.4.1 (Unix) PHP/4.5.3\nLast-Modified: Tue, 15 Oct 2018 10:35:00 GMT\nContent-Length: 6821\nContent-Type: text/html\n(data data data data data ...)\n\\end{verbatim}\n\nSince current practice is to transfer each requested resource in parallel TCP connections, non-persistent HTTP connections are the norm and need to be established for each resource or object that gets requested. First, a brand-new connection must be established with every server and for each object in the requested page. Then the server sends the object back in a response message using the open TCP slave connection. Once the process is complete, the slave connection is closed as a notification to the end system (typically the browser fetches cached objects).\n\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{HTTP-transactions.pdf,\n\nHTTP - persistent connections are used, each request/response pair has its own connection but the connection is kept open (HTTP pipelining must also then be used to make full use of this property). For persistent connections, the server leaves the TCP connection open after sending a response. Subsequent requests and responses between the same client and server can be sent over the same connection. Such connections are often used to avoid connection setup overheads especially in the case of applications needing many objects. Typically, only other servers (proxies) and caches use non-persistent connections.\n\n11 of 49",
    "Computer Networks \\hfill EPFL - Fall semester 2017\n\nThis is why HTTP servers can also be programmed to leave the TCP connection open after sending a response. This is called a {\\em persistent connection}. Subsequent requests and responses between the same client and server are then sent over the same connection. In particular, an entire Web page (the initial request above, the basic HTML file, and the images) can be sent over a single persistent TCP connection. Moreover, multiple Web pages residing on the same server can be sent from the server to the same client over a single persistent TCP connection. These responses (objects) can be made back-to-back, without waiting for the client to issue another request ({\\em pipelining}). Typically, the HTTP server closes a connection when it isn't used for a certain time (a configurable timeout interval). When the server receives the back-to-back requests, it sends the objects back-to-back. The default mode of HTTP uses persistent connections with pipelining.\n\n\\paragraph*{}\nHTTP servers maintain no information about its clients (it's a {\\em stateless protocol}). This simplifies the design, but has prompted engineers to develop {\\em cookies} as a technique to have the server learn thousands of simultaneous TCP connections. But because a website often wants to identify users, they need to have their websites collect user data. When a Web site wants to identify users, cookies enable users to keep track as they visit other Web pages on the site or revisit the same pages. Cookie technology has four components: (1) a cookie header line to be included in the HTTP response message, (2) a cookie header line in the HTTP request message, (3) a cookie file kept on the user's end system and managed by the user's browser, and (4) a back-end database at the Web site.\n\n\\paragraph*{}\nCookies can be used to identify a user. The first time a user visits a site, the user can browse through the site after logging in with their username and password. As they continue to visit, the provider is able to identify and track the user, thereby identifying the user as the same user. They can then provide customized services for him, and store specific information about the user, ensuring that the user is provided with the type of information he likes through personalized Web pages. This is illustrated in the back-to-back responses sent by Site 1, Site 2, Site 3 and fall semester 2017 saved to the user's system. Web information separated by responses \"Server 1\", \"Server 2\", etc. from the Web server, where each server is associated with a unique multiple back-to-back responses which are illustrated next. Using a shared connection allows the user to have fewer interruptions when clicking on multiple link objects. With HTTP, the user is able to access the required information. Also, with Web learning through \"Server 3\", Web servers 10-12 followed by HTTP pipelining as in (a) and (b). The design illustrates response types for persistent connections and persistent Web server.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{con1.png}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{con2.png}\n\\end{center}\n\nThe addit{ion}al applied (a) access is provided through persistent connection allowing the entity that satellites HTTP requests on the behalf of an end system (e.g., \"server 9\" and \"server 7\"). Here the Web pages sat{isf}y bookmarked tags, assessing the Web server response time shown below. When a request is made from a client's browser to a Web server, it takes into account valid authentication and timestamps. This assists Web servers in developing customized responses for users when a request is being made. Always requests again to the server. \n\nWhen there are multiple pages, the connection remains open until $t+1$ response. This is a closed connection. Only certain types of information are sent to the Web server, making fast browsing times. The e.g. server common response shown above is open until respond. \n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{con3.png}\n\\end{center}\n\nThis is typical behavior. A Web cache is purchased and  administered ensuring a fast response for frequently requested objects on behalf of a shared Web server.\n",

For example, a university might install a cache on its campus network and configure all of the campus browsers to point to the cache. Or a major residential ISP (such as AOL) might install one or more caches in its network and preconfigure its shipped browsers to point to the installed caches.\n\n\\noindent\nWeb caching has seen deployment in the Internet for two reasons. First, a Web cache can substantially reduce the response time for a client request, particularly if the bottleneck bandwidth between the client and the origin server is much less than the bottleneck bandwidth between the cache and the origin server. For a high-speed corporate network, the cache is installed in the same network as the client. If the cache has the requested object, then the object will be transmitted to the client at the speed of the network. Second, Web caches can substantially reduce traffic on an institution\u2019s access link to the Internet. By reducing traffic, the institution (for example a company or a university) does not have to upgrade bandwidth, thereby reducing costs. Historically, companies and universities have paid their ISPs based on the traffic sent and received. Web caching can also reduce Web traffic in the Internet as a whole, thereby improving performance and applications.\n\n\\noindent\nTo make sure the proxy server doesn\u2019t serve stale data to its clients, it can send conditional GETs to the origin server to validate that the object is still fresh. It is easy for a cache to serve stale objects if it doesn\u2019t do this validation (since the cache is unaware that the origin server has a newer version of the object), but otherwise it just intercepts requests and acts like any other server.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{2.5: DNS}\n\n\\noindent\nHosts are both identified by their \\textbf{IP-Address} and their Hostnames. An IP address consists of 32 bits and has a rigid hierarchical structure. An IP address, such as 121.7.0.56, is difficult to remember. Hostnames, on the other hand, are mnemonic and easier to remember. The DNS (Domain Name Service) translates hostnames to IP addresses. For example, www.google.com is translated to 121.7.0.56. To perform the translation, the application invokes the DNS and passes it the hostname as a parameter. The DNS in turn returns the IP address to the application. This is done in order to send an HTTP request message to a Web server www.hostname.com, the user\u2019s host must obtain its IP address. This is done in the following steps:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item 1. The user machine runs the client side of the DNS application.\n    \\item 2. The browser extracts the hostname from the URL and passes it to the client side of the DNS application.\n    \\item 3. The DNS client sends a query containing the hostname to the DNS server.\n    \\item 4. The DNS client eventually receives a response, which includes the IP-address desired.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{2.5: DNS (continued)}\n\\newpage\n13 of 49",
    "\\textbf{5.} Once the browser receives the IP address from DNS, it can initiate a TCP connection to the HTTP server process located at port 80 at that IP address.\n\nWe see from this example that DNS adds an additional delay that can sometimes be substantial. Fortunately the desired IP address is often cached in a ``nearby'' DNS server, which helps to reduce DNS resolution delay as well as the average DNS delay. DNS provides a few other important services in addition to translating hostnames to IP addresses:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Host aliasing.} A host with a complicated hostname can have one or more alias names. For example, a hostname such as ``relay1.west-coast.enterprise.com'' could have, say, two aliases such as ``enterprise.com'' and ``www.enterprise.com''. In this case, the hostname relay1.west-coast.enterprise.com is called the canonical hostname. Alias hostnames, when present, are typically shorter and easier to remember.\n    \\item \\textbf{Mail server aliasing.} For obvious reasons, it's highly desirable that e-mail addresses be mnemonic. For example, if Bob has an account with Yahoo mail, Bob's e-mail address might be as simple as \\textbf{bob@yahoo.com}. However, the hostname ``yahoo.com'' is quite generic; it cannot be used as the canonical hostname of a mail server. Instead, the canonical hostname of Bob's mail server might be, say, ``mx. yahoo.com''. To hide this canonical hostname from its uses, Yahoo mail has a DNS\n        \\item \\textbf{Load distribution.} DNS is also used to perform load distribution among replicated servers. Busy sites such as CNN, Yahoo, and Google are replicated over multiple servers, with each server running on a different end system and each having a different IP address. For replicated Web server, a set of IP addresses is thus associated with one canonical hostname. For example, the hostname ``www.google.com'' is associated with a set of IP addresses, with each address being the IP address of one of Google's replicated Web servers. DNS performs load distribution by rotating the order of the IP addresses in the set of IP addresses that it returns in response to a client query. DNS rotation is discussed in more detail in Section 2.5.\n        \nWhen a DNS client initially maps a hostname to an IP address, it receives the entire set of IP addresses; it then selects one of the IP addresses in the set when sending a HTTP request. The selected IP address is cached and used for future requests as it is the canonical hostname for a distributed file system.\n    \n\\noindent An overview of the DNS architecture is shown in Figure 2.9.\n\\end{enumerate}\n    \nTo get the needed information for a hostname translation, the client first contacts one of the top-level DNS servers, which then redirects the client to the name servers for the authoritative domain (e.g., enterprise.com) or to the next top-level domain class (.net, .com. etc.). These replies may provide the IP addresses for the hosts.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htp]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=8cm]{dns.jpg}\n    \\caption{Overview of distributed, hierarchical database of DNS servers}\n    \\label{fig:dns}\n\\end{figure}\n\nA solution can involve physically accessing the hosts (such as Web servers and mail servers) on the Internet must provide publically accessible DNS records that map their canonical hosts to their authoritative domain name servers.\n    \n\\begin{subequation}\n    \\label{eq:eq:1}\n\\end{subequation}\n    \n\\text{We complete the cache of the IP addresses of authoritative domains}\n\n'abord DNS can be queried recursively where the client may send a query to the DNS resolver on the authoritative domain. The response may be obtained and either cached or the query can go on until the deadline expires. The iterative model of querying DNS is used in situations where the client does not immediately expect a response. Instead, the server queries the authoritative domain server where the authoritative domain servers may reply directly.",
    "to IP addresses. They can choose to implement their own servers to hold these records or pay to have them stored by some service provider.\n\nThere is another important type of DNS server called \n\\textbf{the local DNS server (or default name server)}. It doesn't strictly belong to the hierarchy of servers. Each ISP has a local DNS server. When a host connects to an ISP, it provides the host with the IP addresses of one or more of its local DNS servers (typically through DHCP, Section 4.4). When a host makes a DNS query, the query is sent to the local DNS server, which acts as a proxy, forwarding the query into the DNS server hierarchy. Thus, a company's local DNS server may receive DNS queries directly from company's hosts. If the local DNS server has a resource record matching the query, it returns the record immediately to the host. Since hosts and local DNS servers are often in the same vicinity, this can often result in a significant saving. If not, the local DNS server acts as a proxy, forwarding the query\ninto the DNS servers hierarchy.\n\n\\textbf{The three types of DNS servers are illustrated in Figure 2.21:}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Root DNS servers: There are 13 root DNS servers around the world. \n    \\item Top-level domain (TLD) servers: These servers manage the TLD zone files. \n    \\item Authoritative DNS servers: These servers hold DNS records for domain names. These are the final repositories of DNS records, providing definitive answers to DNS queries.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{dns-servers.png} \n\nWhen a DNS query is made, it can be resolved by looking up the information in a cache. This cache is maintained by the DNS servers to reduce the response time. The query is first applied to the local DNS server and if it is not found, the query is passed to the TLD server and finally to the root server if necessary.\n\n\\textbf{DNS Caching:} To drastically improve delay performance and to decrease the number of DNS messages exchaning among the internet, a \\textbf{DNS cache} is maintained by both the local DNS server and the individual host.\n\n\\textbf{Resource records: DNS defines the types of resource records that can appear in the DNS database.} A resource record is a four-tuple that contains:\n\\begin{quote}\n    (Name, Value, Type, TTL)\n\\end{quote}\n\nSome common types are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Type=A}, the Name is a hostname and the Value is the IP address.\n    \\item \\textbf{Type=NS}, the Name is a domain name and the Value is a hostname of an authoritative DNS server that knows how to obtain the IP address for hosts in the domain.\n    \\item \\textbf{Type=CNAME}, the Value is a canonical hostname for the alias hostname.\n    \\item \\textbf{Type=MX}, the Value is the hostname of a mail server that has an alias hostname.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\textit{Page 15 of 49}",
    "IV. If Type$=$\\text{MX}, then Value is the canonical name of a mail server that has an alias hostnameName.\n\nIf a DNS server is authoritative for a particular hostname, the  the DNS server will contain a \nType A record for the hostname. If a server is not authoritative for a hostname, then it will \ncontain a Type NS record for the domain that includes the hostname. If the server contains a Type A record that provides the IP address of the DNS server in the Value field of the NS record.\n\nHow would you like to send a DNS query message directly from the host that is sending it to \nsome DNS server? This can easily be done with the \\texttt{nslookup} program. After invoking \\texttt{nslookup}, you send a DNS query by only specifying the hostname. For each query sent, indeed for each subsequent line typed in \\texttt{DNS server}, \\texttt{nslookup} will display the records included in the reply (in a human-readable format).\n\nHow does this get attacked? The first type of attack that comes to mind is a DNS \nhandwioth-fboding attack. This way, the majority of legitimate DNS queries get never answered. There are techniques though. DNS can ask many nameservers at the same time for an answer. We won\u2019t go into details here. An even nastier attack that has successfully used the DNS service is, called \\textit{dnssec}.\n\n\\subsection*{2.6 Peer-to-Peer applications}\nDepending on the location of the server\u2019s access link in the topology, peers might be forced to access link by a lot. On the other hand, if the server is deep in the core network itself, then the peer gets a better share of the bandwidth. \n\nBut there is a problem with this architecture: the distribution $(T)_{p2P}$, designates the distribution time. Denote as $N_{F}$ the size of the file, and let each peer download some copies of the file to each of the N peers. For the distribution version involved, we have the measures $D_{p2P}$, Let $u_{s}$, denote the download rate by the server and $d_{r}$ the download rate \\'of some peer; as such, we have:\n\\[ \nu_{s} = \\max{\\left(\\frac{N_{F}}{F.s},\\frac{N_{F}}{s}+ \n\\frac{N_{F}}{r}\\right)}\n\\]\nFor N large enough, $N_{F} \\propto \\frac{1}{t}$, where the greater number and thus the distribution time grows linearly with the number of clients.",
    "Computer Networks \\hfill EPFL - Fall semester 2017\n\nIn a P2P architecture, when a peer receives some file data, it can use its own upload capacity to redistribute the data to other peers, thus reducing the download time. At the beginning of the distribution, only the server has the file. Then the server must send each file to the file at least once to other peers. Thus the minimum distribution time is at least $F/u_s$. Each peer will have to download and can reconstitute all of this file of this file size in the \\textit{F} size, seconds. Thus the minimum distribution time is at least \\textit{F+u_s}. The total upload capacity of the system as a whole is equal to the sum of the server plus the n users of the system, that is, $u_s+n$. Thus, the system must deliver \\textit{F} to each of the $\\textit{N}$ peers, thus delivering a total of $NF$. This can't be done at a rate faster than $u_s + n$. Thus, the minimum distribution time is also at least $NF/u_s+ n$. This we have:\n\n$$ D_{NF} = max \\left\\lbrace \\frac{F}{u_s}; \\frac{NF}{u_s + n} \\right\\rbrace_{q_{u_s}}$$\n\nIn reality, this serves as a good approximation of the actual minimum distribution time. With N large enough, the time is determined by the third term. Because it grows in sub-linear time, with \\textit{N}, this P2P architecture can deliver significant benefits for a service provider. It can help a provider scales and self-using this. The scalability is a disconnect between peers being redistribution as well as computers of bits go.\n\n\\textbf{Bittorrent} is a popular P2P protocol for file distribution. In BitTorrent, there is always a collection of all peers participating in the distribution of a particular file is called a torrent. Peers first register themselves to a tracker. When a bee question joins a torrent, it first registers itself with this central tracker. The tracker is an infrastructure node which tracks all the peers participating in the torrent. When a peer registers with this tracker, it receives a list of all or a subset of all peers participating in this tracker. The peer then attempts to connect to some of the other peers in this list to obtain the file.\n\nWhen peer registers with the tracker it is called a \\textbf{tracker}. When a peer joins a torrent, it registers itself with a central tracker. The tracker is an infrastructure node that tracks all peers participating in the torrent. When a peer registers with this query, it receives a list of all or a subset of all peers participating in the refresher. The peer then attempts to connect with some other peers in this list to obtain the file. At any time, each peer has a set of neighbors. The peer's list of neighbors includes some which have \"many alice\". Alice received pieces of other files to upload and some which have less than Alice received pieces. Allice uses a rarest first approach to determine which pieces to request from neighbors. This means that it first requests those pieces which are least available among its eight-based neighbors but has not yet received. This prevents the system from being overly depend-attached on any one particular peer. This allows each peer join to a selection of only those neighboring peers available over time. At any given time, each peer will have a set of \nneighbors in this list.\n\n\\hfill 17 of49",
    "chunks from the file. Periodically, Alice will ask each of her neighboring peers (over the TCP connections) for the list of the chunks they have. In deciding which chunks (that she doesn\u2019t have yet) to request, Alice uses a technique called rarest first: the idea is to determine the chunks that are the rarest among her neighbors and then request those rarest chunks first. As time passes in this way, most quickly redistribute, aiming to equalize the numbers of copies of each chunk in the torrent.\n \nTo determine which requests for chunks from neighbors she responds to, Alice gives priority to the neighbors that are currently supplying her data at the highest rate. Specifically, periodically (say, every 10 seconds), Alice measures the rate at which she receives data (in chunks per second) from each of her neighbors. She then sends chunks to those four peers that have most recently, at the highest rate. She re-evaluates her choices every 10 seconds. (Every 30 seconds, she also selects another peer at random and sends it chunks as well. This so-called \u201coptimistically unchokes\u201d the peer. Since the file is being distributed to Bob, Bob generally will be receiving from, and sending to, 4 neighbors. Bob\u2019s sending rate to Alice can therefore be at most four times a typical sending rate.)\nThis tit-for-tat mode of choosing request may appear a bit whimsical at first, but it is, in fact praised by users as being effective, as the fastest downloaders get the most uploads. The effect is that peers capable of uploading at compatible rates tend to find each other. Conversely, the so-called leechers who do not upload do not get service from other peers. This queuing policy provides incentives for users to upload and not just download. Alice thus keeps the upload connections open by giving chunks to the peers from which she is downloading at the highest rates.\nTo know what to ask for the content you\u2019re looking for in a P2P network, you must have some sort of coordinate system of peers and their IP addresses. Most P2P networks implement a special distributed system meant to efficiently join the address with a set of values. To illustrate this, a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) is used. What is a DHT? Global-scale deployments of peers is more difficult to track than those through a Distributed Hash Table (DHT).\nThe peers have an identifier for each peer, where each identifier is a integer in the range [0, ..., N-1]. The hashing functions are used to map each file to a key within the same range and to identify each key with some file location. Assign each (key, value) pair to the peers whose identifier is the closest to the key.\n\nTo insert a (key, value) pair into the DHT, Alice determines the peer whose identifier is closest to the key. She then asks a message that uses the routing table for the data, and maps the value to the peer\u2019s location. Say Alice\u2019s identifier is 13 and her closest peer\u2019s value to the key is 15 and the next to closest peer value\u2019s identifier is 2. The closest peer location then finds the key and reports its location that contains every identifier, each pair has some value for key-based storage management. Each other node joins with the routing table that maps each peer to its neighbor. The value for each pair is then found by mapping the value (requests) for a given routing. This technique is what is referred to as a routing table of neighbors.\nHere, we see an adjacent peer whose neighbor is responsible for certain keys, it sends a message to those keys asking for value for each of the routing pairs. Whenever there is a peer that maps the value it \u201cgeographically\u201d known, it forwards it to the neighbor\n\n[Diagram]\n\n18 of 49",
    "(assessor neighbor or one of the shortcut neighbors) which is the closest to the key. $A \\ DHT \\ can \\ be \\ designed \\ so \\ that \\ both \\ the \\ number \\ of \\ neighbors \\ per \\ peer \\ as \\ well \\ as \\ the \\ number \\ of \\ messages \\ per \\ query \\ is \\ O(log \\ N)$, where \\ $N$ \\ is \\ the \\ number \\ of \\ peers.\n\nBecause a peer can come and go without warning, we also must be concerned about maintaining the DHT overlay. To do this, each peer tracks its first and second successors. Each peer periodically verifies that its two successors are alive. When a peer leaves, its predecessor replaces him with the next alive peer, and gets his second successor from his first. If a successor of the peers has not yet announced him.\n\nFor a peer to join, it asks what his predecessor and successor needs to be based on his identifier, and then arranges for the peers around him to update their information.\n\n\\subsection{2.7: Socket programming}\nRecall that a typical network application consists of a pair of programs --a client program and a server program-- running on different end systems. When a user requests a web page, the client program on its own end system reads the address of the accessed page and forwards it via the software running on the user's end system. Because network programming is more useful if you know how to do it within the reach of socket usage, we can examine one of the victories.\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{path_to_image}\n  \\caption{Socket programming}\n\\end{figure}\n\nA socket is the \"door of the house\" which allows a process to send data to another process. A socket is the full name of the mailing scheme applied here. It acts as a locus of these communication procedures.\n\nOf course, there can be various methods of socket initiation, tracking, and data transmission. The concept remains the same in both UDP and TCP socket programming. UDP does not guarantee delivery; instead, it provides the fastest transmission mechanism. TCP, on the other hand, guarantees packet delivery via the three-way handshake. Please note the file for checking out the data flow engineering details of the UDP protocol.\n\nA network application consists of:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item API\n    \\item IP\n    \\item UDP\n\\end{itemize}\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{path_to_image}\n  \\caption{A network application}\n\\end{figure}\n\nHence there are two types of sockets: $tcp$ and $udp$. We specifically created the socket's port number for special purposes. The client and the server use the port number to map where information is being sent. The client extracts the server name and database after being assigned. The client socket then gets settled and imprinted with an IP address, port number, and information for each message. UDP socket applications are few because they do not guarantee evangelic replying. API may remove processes.\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{path_to_image}\n  \\caption{Socket setup example}\n\\end{figure}\n\n19 \\ of \\ 49",
    "When using \\textbf{TCP}, before the client and server can start to send data to each other, they first need to handshake and establish a TCP connection. One end of the TCP connection is attached to the \\texttt{client socket} and the other end is attached to a \\texttt{server socket}. When setting the connection, we associate it with the client socket address and the server socket address. With the TCP connection established, when one side wants to send data to the other side, it pushes the data into the TCP connection via its \\texttt{socket}. As in the case of UDP, the TCP socket is identified with a \\texttt{4-tuples}.\n\nSome sockets are \\texttt{listening sockets}, which are used to set up and establish the connection. The server program must have a special socket (the \\texttt{listening socket}) that is listening for incoming connection-setup requests from the client. The client sends a \\texttt{segment} with a connection request to the server. This is done in the client program by creating a TCP socket. When a \\texttt{client} sends a request to the \\texttt{server}, the special \\texttt{server socket}, that is commonly referred to \\texttt{welcomes socket}, will create a new \\texttt{TCP socket} attached to the \\texttt{same port} as the \\texttt{welcoming socket}.

By logical communication, we mean that, from a process's perspective, it is as if it were directly connected to the remote process. Web-browsers use the Transport-layer. Transport-layer services and protocols are implemented in the end systems but not in network routers. On the sending side, the transport layer converts the \\textbf{application-layer messages} it receives from a \\texttt{sending application process} into \\textbf{transport-layer packets}, known as \\texttt{transport-layer segments}, by (possibly) breaking the application messages into smaller chunks and adding a transport-layer header to each chunk. \n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item \\text{\\textbf{Transport-layer services:}} Provide logical communication between application processes running on different hosts\n  \\item \\text{\\textbf{Transport-layer segments:}} Transport-layer packets \n  \\item \\text{\\textbf{Demultiplexing (at host receiving end):}} \n      \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item Checks the fields in the transport-layer segment \n        \\item Determines the correct process\n        \\item Directs the segment to that process\n      \\end{itemize}\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAt the receiving end, the transport layer examines the fields of a transport-layer segment to determine the process to which the segment belongs and then delivers the segment to that process. In transport-layer network models, there are \\texttt{two types of port numbers}: the well-known port numbers that are acknowledged across host processes, and the \\texttt{ephemeral (non-persistent)} port numbers that are randomly generated for the duration of a specific TCP connection. \n\nWhen receiving a \\texttt{transport-layer segment} from the network layer, a host uses the protocol that provides multiplexing/demultiplexing at the receiving end host. This is called \\textbf{demultiplexing}.\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{multiplexing.png}\n\\caption{Multiplexing/Demultiplexing in TCP connection}\n\\end{figure}\n\n20 of 49",
    "The Internet\u2019s network-layer protocol has a name\u2014IP, for Internet Protocol. IP provides logical communication between hosts. The IP service model is a best-effort delivery service. This means that IP makes its best effort to deliver segments between communicating hosts, but it makes no guarantees. In particular, it does not guarantee segment delivery, it does not guarantee orderly delivery of segments, and it does not guarantee the integrity of the data in the segments. For this reason, IP is said to be an unreliable service.\n\nThe most fundamental responsibility of UDP and TCP is to extend IP\u2019s delivery service between two end systems to a delivery service between two processes running on the end systems. Extending host-to-host delivery to process-to-process delivery is called transport-layer multiplexing and demultiplexing. UDP and TCP also provide integrity checking by including error-detection fields in their segments\u2019 headers. These two minimal transport-layer services\u2014process-to-process data delivery and error checking\u2014are the only two services that UDP provides. In particular, like IP, UDP is an unreliable service\u2014it does not guarantee that data sent by one process will arrive intact to the destination process. On the other hand, TCP provides reliable data transfer. It ensures that data is delivered from sending process to receiving process, correctly and in order. The services that UDP and TCP provide to applications, processes, and the paradigms for the different service models, unreliable and reliable, are summarized in Table 1.1. We first present UDP and then TCP. We\u2019ll wrap up this overview by considering how these transport-layer services are used by certain popular Internet applications.\n\n\\textbf{UDP} takes messages from the application process, attaches source and destination port number fields for the multiplexing/demultiplexing service, and passes the resulting segment to the network layer. The network layer encapsulates the transport-layer segment into an IP datagram and then makes a best-effort attempt to deliver the segment to the receiving host. If the segment arrives at the receiving host, UDP uses the destination port number to deliver the segment\u2019s data to the correct application process. Note that with UDP there is no handshaking between sending and receiving transport-layer entities before sending a segment. For this reason, UDP is said to be connectionless.\n\n\\textbf{Because UDP does not include a congestion-control mechanism}, network applications that use UDP can send data as fast as desired (subject to the rate at which the application produces data, the capabilities of the source and destination hosts, and the limitations of the intervening links between source and destination). Many popular applications use UDP, including DNS, which we discuss in Chapter 2, and the Internet telephony application, Skype. Because real-time applications can often tolerate some amount of packet loss, but require a minimal rate of packet sending, they often use UDP instead of TCP. Also, because UDP avoids the overhead associated with connection establishment, it is preferred to TCP in applications that can tolerate packet loss. Less control information needs to be transmitted with UDP (8 bytes of overhead) compared to TCP (20 bytes of overhead).\n",
    "\\textbf{TCP} is harder to implement as a transfer protocol. How can you guarantee correct transmission in the transport layer when the network layer doesn't?\n\nFirst of all, let's see how the transport layer would work if the underlying layers were 100\\% reliable. There would be no need for any checks, and thus it would just send the data through on one side and decrypt it on the other.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.65\\linewidth]{images/slide-2.png} \n\\end{center}\nNow, more realistically, imagine no packets are ever lost, but packets can be corrupted. In this case, the receiver would use the checksum to determine if it has a corrupted packet and if he does, send a \\textbf{NACK} (NegativeAcknowledgement) back to the sender. The sender would then resend the packet. If the packet is valid, he sends an \\textbf{ACK} (Acknowledgement) and the sender can send the next packet. \n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.65\\linewidth]{images/slide-3.png} \n\\end{center}",
    "Next, imagine packets can also be lost. In this case you need to be able to have a $timeout$ (used to overcome data loss) function for the sender side, if he hasn\u2019t an $ACK$ or $NACK$ after a certain amount of time, considers the packet lost and resends it. In this case, when he resends it, he needs to prepend it with the $ACK$ that was lost, in which case he already has the packet). For this reason a $sequence$ $number$ is added to headers. This can only be one bit if we wait for the $ACK$ between each set bit.\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{drawing}\n\\caption{}\n\\label{fig:figure1}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThese are tools that can be used when designing a reliable $data$ $transfer$ $protocol$. $Checksums$ can be used to detect data corruption at the receiver. $ACKs$ and retransmissions can be used to overcome data loss.

In contrast to UDP, which is connectionless, TCP enables two host computers to establish a connection and reliably transfer data between them. The main responsibilities of the TCP protocol are the reliable transfer of data, flow control, congestion control, and error detection, retransmissions, reordering segments, and connection setup/tear down.\n\nEach host supporting TCP has a TCP entity to support the host's own processes and protocols. There must be a systematic way to establish and terminate TCP connections and to ensure all segments are delivered in sequence. TCP connections are established using a three-way handshake and terminated using a graceful teardown or an abort. To maintain TCP connections, each host supports a Transmission Control Block (TCB) that contains all the required variables such as sequence numbers, acks, windows, etc.\n\nA TCP connection provides a full-duplex service. If there is a TCP connection between Process A on one host and Process B on another host, data flow from Process A to Process B can proceed simultaneously and at the same time as application-layer data flows from Process B to Process A.\n\n\\emph{24 of 49}",
    "TCP connections are also always \\textit{point-to-point} (they are between a single sender and a single receiver).\n\nWhen a client wants to establish a connection to a server, the client application process first informs the client transport layer that it wants to establish a connection to a process in the server. The TCP in the client proceeds to establish a TCP connection with TCP in the server. To do this, the client first sends a special TCP segment (a TCP \\textbf{SYN}; the server responds with a second special TCP segment (a TCP \\textbf{SYN ACK}); and finally the client responds again with a third special segment. The first two steps are used for \\textit{handshaking} (Establishment), but the third step, in effect, is a message to say (to the naive host), this connection-establishment procedure is over (official request: a \\textbf{three}-way handshake). Once a connection is established, the two hosts are said to be connected with a \\textbf{full duplex} pipe, so that as the client and server, buffers, are created to store sent/received data. (Data can go both ways at the same time as full \\textbf{duplex service}).  \n\n\n\\begin{center}\n\t\\includegraphics [width=7.00cm,height=4.00cm]{../tex/251px-AN_TCP_CONNECTION.svg.png}\n\t\\begin{tabular} {|c|c|}\n\t\t\\hline \n\t\t\\begin{turn}{90}\n\t\t\tfrom port 1234                 \n\t\t\\end{turn}&\n\t\t\\begin{turn}{270}\n\t\t\tto port 80\n\t\t\\end{turn} \\\\\n\t\t\\hline \n\t\tConnection created & Connection set \\\\\n\t\t\\hline \n\t\tReceive & Send\\\\\n\t\t\\hline\n\t\tACK & SYN\\\\\n\t\t\\hline\n\t\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n \n\\textbf{so }:- the four-tuple of TCP connection established, describes the two end of the data stream: for example IP:256.98.43.33/1234 \u2194 IP132.54.74.121/80.\n\nProcess includes data sent through this type of connection (following the establishment of TCP) - \\textbf{TCP \\textit{buffer management}} - \n\nIn today\u2019s Internet, the sending process controls: the sending rate (again slow start, congestion window/tcp segment window), process.\n\n\\[ \\frac{segment\\ window}{time} \\]\n\nThe figure above describes the TCP Segment Header. In general, each TCP segment will have a MSS (\\textit{Maximum Segment Size }) field (along with the encapsulated upper layer data portion thus filling in 96-bits of data length). Each TCP header includes 20-bytes of overhead (segments being size and so must be a multiple of the standard MSS). \\textbf{Client applications} do not need to be kept aware of incoming packet order; that is, whether they are separated/reassembled across/from different packets.\n\nTCP not only in charge of passing application\u2019s bytes from network and NYT connections to the first host, serves as the quality of service to select proper TCP endpoints and implementations.\n\nTCP segments consist of both header fields and a data field. The data field contains a chunk of application data. These header fields allow TCP receiver-side implementations policies, as an in-built organizational manager. For example the 32-bit \\textbf{sequence number} and \\textbf{Acknowledgment} and \\textbf{ACK number} of [ of oldest byte missing, cumulative field]. \n",
    "Computer Networks \\hfill EPFL - Fall semester 2017\n\nTCP views data as an unstructured, but \\textbf{ordered}, stream of bytes. The sequence number for a segment is the byte-stream number of the first byte in the segment. The acknowledgment number that Host A puts in its segment is the sequence number of the next byte Host A is expecting from Host B. The bytes are implicitly numbered.\n\nTCP uses a timer-based retransmission mechanism to recover from lost segments. The sender retransmits the segment with oldest unACKed sequence number. To calculate the length of the timeout interval, there are a couple things to take into account. Clearly, the timeout should be greater than the RTT, or round-trip time. But just how much greater? Simple estimation of RTT is done by taking the amount of time between when the segment is sent and when an acknowledgment for it is received. This is the sample RTT. We call it SampleRTT. The SampleRTT for a segment is measured from time first time it is sent (i.e. ignoring retransmissions). We will denote RTT simply as RTT. Also, TCP never computes a SampleRTT for a segment that has been retransmitted.\n\nBecause the sender does not know which segment caused the acknowledgment, it can't annotated SampleRTT to that segment. Thus, some sort of weighted average of the SampleRTT is used to compute a smooth estimate of RTT. We will call this an EstimatedRTT. This is an average of the sample RTT values. To make the estimate smoother, ie. less variable, TCP uses a weighted average of the RTT samples. This equates EstimatedRTT`;\n\n$$ \\text{EstimatedRTT} = 0.875 \\times \\text{EstimatedRTT} + 0.125 \\times \\text{SampleRTT} $$\n\nIn addition to having an estimate of the RTT, it is also valuable to have a measure of the variability of the RTT. The RTT variation, DevRTT, is an estimate of how much SampleRTT typically deviates from EstimatedRTT. It is a function of the variance of the RTT. The final timeout value is calculated as such:\n\n$$ \\text{Timeout} = \\text{EstimatedRTT} + 4 \\times \\text{DevRTT} $$\n\nThe reason is simple: with event-triggered retransmissions is that the timer period can be made sufficiently conservative to counteract loss problems. Consider the following scenario: the sender transmits a segment; receiver sends back an ACK, and a fast retransmit is triggered. Thus, without retransmissions TCP would not have to recover from (possibly duplicate) ACKs. A second reason is that the sender can learn which segment was acknowledged. Clearly if a segment could be SENDer: and if it should be inferred, the fast-retransmit should retransmit segments. However an explicit mechanism does not exist for the marking of segments as lost. \n\nThe timer should be triggered in the following cases:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item when a segment was sent\n    \\item when an acknowledgment was received\n    \\item when a timeout period was greedy.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nOnce the subsequent duplicate ACKs are received, the TCP sender performs a fast retransmit: the sender retransmits the segment with oldest un-ACKed sequence number. Number them 1, 2, 3...\n\n\\hfill 26 of 49",
    "Computer Networks \\hfill EPFL - Fall semester 2017\n\nevents that trigger a retransmit are timeouts or three duplicate ACKs received. \\textbf{Selective acknowledgment} allows a TCP receiver to acknowledge out-of-order segments selectively rather than just cumulatively acknowledging the last correctly received in-order segment. When combined with selective retransmission---skipping the retransmissions of segments that have already been selectively acknowledged by the receiver---we can see that TCP's recovery mechanism is probably best categorized as a hybrid of GBN and SR protocols.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Go-Back-N:} sender retransmits as soon as one segment ACKs \n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item Go-Back-N is efficient\n        \\item Go-Back-N requires simple ACKs\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Selective Repeat:} selective acknowledgments sent by receiver\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item Selective Repeat efficient\n        \\item Selective Repeat sends ACKs for each segment received\n    \\end{itemize}\n\\end{itemize}\n\nTCP provides a \\textbf{flow-control} service to its applications to eliminate the possibility of the sender overflowing the receiver's buffer. When a TCP connection receives bytes that are correct and in order, it places them in the receiver buffer. The associated application-id read can remove these application messages, but if the application is slow at reading data, the buffer may eventually fill up. After the receiver buffer becomes full, any additional incoming and correct TCP segments may be discarded. At this point, the sender will have to retransmit the discarded data when the application has removed enough data from the receiver buffer.\n\nFlow control is a \\textbf{speed-matching} service---matching the rate at which the sender is sending against the rate at which the receiving application is reading. A TCP sender can find the required rate to send data with the IP network. This flow control method is referred to as congestion control.\n\n\\textbf{TCP provides flow control by using the sender available-to-receive (receiver window)}. The sender keeps track of the \"amount of unacknowledged bytes\" that it has sent into the network. The sender allows up to $\\text{min}\\{\\text{CongestionWindow, ReceiverWindow}\\}$, where ReceiverWindow is the amount of available space at the receiver buffer, and CongestionWindow is the amount of unacknowledged data (as provided by the TCP full-duplex, sliding-window protocol). The TCP protocol determines the ReceiverWindow value from the field advertised as $\\text{rwnd}$ in the TCP segment.\n          \nTo see how this works, suppose that B's ReceiverWindow is 4 KB and that it was advertised to A with $\\text{rwnd} = 4$ KB. Suppose that B has slightly less than 4 KB in the connection buffer by time $t't$. Suppose now that the application process in host B reads one byte from the buffer, and thus this one byte has opened up three more bytes in the buffer. Imagine that B's receiver window is full, and he tells to A in the ACK for the last message he received that $\\text{rwnd} = 0$. At this point, A will not send into the IP. However, when B reads 3 more bytes, as described above, it will send another segment with the updated ReceiverWindow value (i.e., $\\text{rwnd}= 3)$. Using this value, the TCP's receive side opens up. The need for a flow control window to open up each element will continually refresh the buffer, and the acknowledgments will continue a nonzero rwnd value.\n\n27 of 49",
    "\\textbf{Here is a brief explanation on the setup and the tear down of TCP connections:}\n\n\\textbf{Connection:}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item The client-side TCP first sends a special TCP segment to the server-side TCP. This special segment contains no application-layer data. This special segment is referred to as a \\textit{SYN segment}. In addition, the client randomly chooses an \\textit{initial sequence number} and puts this number in the sequence number field. There has been considerable interest in properly randomizing the choice of this initial number to avoid security attacks.\n    \\item Once the TCP SYN segment arrives at the TCP SYN segment at the server side, the server-side TCP extracts the segment from the datagram, allocates the TCP buffers and variables to the connection, and sends a connection-granted segment to the client TCP. This segment also contains no application-layer data. The server also chooses its own \\textit{initial sequence number} and puts this value in the sequence number field of this segment. The SYN segment that the server sends to the client is called a \\textit{SYNACK segment}.\n    \\item Upon receiving the SYNACK segment, the client also allocates buffers and variables to the connection. The client then sends its own acknowledgement segment to the server. This last segment contains no application-layer data. This third segment may contain the first bit of client-to-server data in the segment payload.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\textbf{Disconnection:}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item The client sends a TCP segment to the server, as shown in Figure 3.40. The \\textit{FIN bit} has been set in the \\textit{segment header}. When the server receives this segment, it sends back an acknowledgement. The connection is now in the \u201chalf-closed\u201d state, and the server can still send data to the client, but the client cannot send data to the server.\n    \\item The server then sends its own shutdown segment, which has the \\textit{FIN bit} set. The client acknowledges the shutdown segment.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\textbf{TCP hijacking:} In this type of attack, a hijacker impersonates one of the parties and provides fake content. In the example of a client and server doing a file transfer, a TCP hijacking attack goes when the client talks to the server for a certain file, and the response seems to be fine and honest.\n\n\\fbox{\\begin{minipage}{.8\\textwidth}\nfigure\n\\end{minipage}}\n\n\\textit{28 of 49}",

He must also respond with the correct sequence and ack numbers. When the servers \ndata gets there, if the client has already accepted the hijacker\u2019s data, it simply rejects it. There is \nsome defense to this attack, which is just to randomize sequence numbers (make the sequence \nnumbers unpredictable). \n\n\\textbf{The SYN flood attack:} We\u2019ve seen that a server allocates and initializes connection variables \nand buffers in response to a received SYN. The server then sends a SYNACK in response, and \nwill expect an ACK from the client. If the client does not send an ACK the connection will time \nstep of this 3-way handshake, eventually (often after a minute or more) the server will terminate \nout after having consumed the network and software resources. The TCP connection represented \nby this incomplete TCP stack, also known as the SYN flood attack, is thus used to exhaust a \nlarge number of TCP SYN segments, without completing the third handshake step. With this \nproblem, if the server\u2019s resources for connections become exhausted, the system is unable to \nhandle further legitimate connection requests. This problem is similar to the allocation problem of \ndefense known as SYN cookies are now deployed in most major operating systems. SYN \ncookies works as follows: \n\nInstead of creating a half-open TCP connection for every SYN, the server creates an \ninitial TCP sequence number which is a hash of its IP address, port number, and client IP \naddress and port number plus a secret number. This information is enough to find the \nhalf-open TCP connections for further arrival sequence that respond to the server with the \nACK that sends the client in SYNACK packets which let the cookie \u201cbaked\u201d to the server. \nA legitimate client will respond with a SYNACK sequence number that matches the cookie \ngenerated y the server, enabling the server to reconstruct the SYN from that information. \nHere the correct client is not required to drop the database associated settings since the \nSYN was sent. Until then, the server will not allocate or destination IP address and other \nresources assigned to a valid, half-open connections state. The server\u2019s ISN is incremented \nby an agreed formula. In contrast, the SYN cookies are not applied server memory \nwithout SYN and, hence, valid. The server then creates a fully open connection when the \nserver\u2019s first segment is received from the client, the server resources aren\u2019t allocated any \nmore requests and then let the server know that the server hasn\u2019t yet allocated any \nresources in response to the original bogus SYN. \n\n\\textbf{3.7: TCP Congestion Control} \nIf a sender always tries to send data at the maximum possible throughput (the rate of the \nbottleneck link), its packets may go very slow (or even be lost). This is one of the reasons \nwhy senders that will have to share their common links. This is called flow congestion. This \nis the congestion: \u201cAn overflow occurs and also when any intermediate device. Some of the \nhigh bandwidth router buffers are full in the network delay and some of the connections are \nswitches transmitting packets and interface queue waiting at bottlenecks.\u201d Routers and \nswitches fast enough processing speed can be done through the packets are dropped \n\n29 of 49",
    "(resource waste). The \\textit{effective throughput} is the throughput that is actually used to send new packets. It\u2019s always smaller or equal to the throughput. \n\nThere are two main approaches to congestion control. Either the network layer does the work (packet switches signal congestion to end-hosts), or the transport layer does the work (end-systems signal congestion to each other). TCP must use end-to-end congestion control rather than network-assisted congestion control, since the IP layer provides no explicit feedback to the end-systems regarding network congestion. The approach taken by TCP is to have the sender explicitly adjust its sending rate (or, more precisely, its rate of transmission) as a function of perceived network congestion. The TCP sender sets its window size to its congestion in the path between itself and the destination. The problem, then, is how the sender determines the rate of sender perceives that there is congestion along the path, then the sender reduces its send rate. \n\nThe TCP congestion-control mechanism operating at the sender keeps track of an additional variable, the \\textit{congestion window}. The congestion window, denoted \\textit{CongWin}, imposes a constraint on the rate at which a TCP sender can send traffic into the network. The amount of unacknowledged data at a sender may not exceed the minimum of \\textit{CongWin} and \\textit{RcvWindow}, i.e., \n$$\\textit{LastByteSent} - \\textit{LastByteAcked} \\leq \\min(\\textit{CongWin} , \\textit{RcvWindow}).$$\nThe constraint $\\textit{CongWin}$ is dynamic and is determined by the sender. The sender uses the ACK, which is an acknowledgment sent by the receiver of a successfully received segment, as an indication of network congestion. The ACK is used by the sender to decide whether to increase or decrease its congestion window size. \n\nThe TCP sender also sets a \\textit{threshold} value, denoted \\textit{ssthresh}. This threshold is used by the sender to decide when to switch between two different phases, the slow start phase and the congestion avoidance phase. \n\n\\[ \\text{bdp} = B \\, \\text{bps} \\times \\text{RTT} \\, \\text{sec} \\]\n\nLet us define a \u201closs event\u201d at a TCP sender as the occurrence of either a timeout or the receipt of three duplicate ACKs from the receiver. When there is packet loss (i.e., when a loss event occurs), it is due to congestion in the network. Clearly, a TCP sender does not want to overflow the buffer at the receiving end of the connection, as overflowing a buffer implies that packets have been lost due to congestion. Thus, congestion is inferred after a packet loss event rather than by the sending rate. In the case of TCP congestion, it is important to keep in mind that the sender-to-receiver path, not the sender-to-receiver pair, is congested.\n\nTCP uses two techniques to control the congestion window size: $\\beta$  are acknowledgments of received segments. In TCP, received segments will be received at the TCP sender. Explicit and random segment losses also trigger an increase in the congestion window.\nTCP congestion control will increase the congestion window size (\\textit{cwnd}) as it responds to such acknowledgments or as an indicator of buffer overload. The value of cwnd will increase by approximately one segment for every segment received.\n\nTCP uses acknowledgments to trigger (or clock) its increase in congestion window size (it\u2019s said to be \\textit{self-clocking}). In this manner, the window never increases above what the network can handle before either loss or decrease indicates congestion window instead of throughput.",
    "Computer Networks \\hfill EPFL - Fall semester 2017\n\n\\textbf{How should a TCP sender determine the rate at which it should send?}\nIf TCP senders collectively send too fast, they can congest the network, leading to congestion collapse. If TCP senders are too cautious and send too slowly, they could under utilize the bandwidth in the network. TCP answers these questions using the following guiding principles:\n\n1. A lost segment implies congestion, and hence, the TCP sender's rate should be decreased when a segment is lost.\n2. An acknowledged segment indicates that the network is delivering the sender's segments to the receiver, and hence the sender's rate can be increased when an ACK for an in-flight segment is received.\n\nThese two principles are dynamically balanced using ACKs.\n\n\\textbf{II. Bandwidth probing.} TCP's strategy for adjusting its transmission rate is to increase its transmission rate in response to arriving ACKs until a loss event occurs, at which point, the transmission rate decreases.\n\n\\textbf{How do we increase the window size, to increase it fast enough to utilize the network's capability but finding the correct rate?}\n\n1. Increase the window size \\textbf{exponentially}: by 1 MSS for every ACKed segment (which increases the window double every RTT), when we don't experience segment losses.\n2. Increase the window size \\textbf{linearly}: by 1 MSS per RTT when segment losses occur.\n\n\\textbf{When a TCP connection begins, the value of cwnd is typically initialized to a value of 1 MSS.}\nHence:\n\n\u2022 In the slow-start state, the value of the window begins at 1 MSS and increases exponentially.\n\u2022 When the value of cwnd increases fast, the TCP sender sets the slow start threshold to half of its current cwnd value (congestion avoidance). TCP then enters the congestion-avoidance state, where the window size increases linearly as described above.\n\u2022 If, before the threshold is reached, a segment loss occurs due to a timeout, the sender re-enters the slow-start state and cwnd is reset to 1 MSS. This functionality is known as slow-start.\n\n\\textbf{When we have losses that are close to the threshold, we should retransmit these duplicate ACKs through the fast rexmit and TCP goes into recovery mode.}\n\nWhen the value of the window reaches the threshold, and the same time a fast retransmit is detected (this retransmit needed for segment), TCP enters congestion avoidance state.\n\nWhen we have the case that we experience a loss event, TCP sets the threshold to half the window size of the previous congestion window. TCP increases the size of the window \\textbf{linearly} from there.\n\\newpage",

Suppose that HI is sending information to H2. This information is sent as segments into the transport layer, as packets at the network layer, and as frames at the link-layer level. At the network layer, routers between the sender, HI, and the receiver, H2, are responsible for receiving data at one router and forwarding this data to the next router on the path. The network layer at the sender, HI, packages data into IP datagrams, and delivers these segments to the IP stack at the router Rl. The primary role of the router is to forward datagrams from input links to output links.\n\n32 of 49",
    "Computer Networks \\hfill EPFL - Fall semester 2017\n\nThe role of the network layer is to move packets from a sending host to a receiving host. To do so, two important network-layer functions can be identified:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item \\textbf{Forwarding.} When a packet arrives at a router\u2019s input link, the router must move the packet to the appropriate output link. It refers to the per-router local process of transferring a packet from an input link interface to the appropriate output link interface.\n  \\item \\textbf{Routing.} The network layer must determine the route or path taken by packets as they flow from a sender to a receiver. The algorithms that calculate these paths are referred to as routing algorithms. It refers to the network-wide process that determines the end-to-end paths that packets take from source to destination. This means that the router populates the forwarding table.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nEvery router has a \\textbf{forwarding table.} A router forwards a packet by examining the value of a field in the arriving packet\u2019s header, and then searching for this header value in the forwarding table. Depending on the value in the header, the header value is matched, the table indicates the outgoing link to which the packet is forwarded on. The table does this by using a destination-based forwarding model. Packets are forwarded based on the value of the destination address field (manually by network administrators or can be filled automatically as a result of the routing process), protocol specific prepends, depending on the incoming interface.\n\nThe \\textbf{routing process} determines the values that are inserted into the routing tables. This determines the route a router, the packet, can take. It can include the time it takes to reach a destination. The routing process can be implemented with a centralized or a decentralized design. In the centralized design, a physically centralized controller is responsible for routing decisions. In a decentralized design, routing decisions are made by each router independently (using information exchanged with neighbors to compute forwarding tables). Most existing network routers are based on the decentralized design and exchange control messages using the \\textbf{Routing Information Protocol (RIP)}.\n\nSome network-layer protocols require the routers along the chosen path from source to destination to maintain connection state information (e.g. link resources). Others do not, instead proceed without connections and forwards packets independently. These services are summarized in the following:\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Network-layer \\textbf{connection-oriented} service: guarantees end-to-end delay and bandwidth before sending and forwarding packets. This means that a virtual circuit must be set up before sending packets. The Internet's network-layer protocol IP does not provide a connection-oriented service but does support quality of service (QoS). The service guarantees bandwidth minimum transmission requirements.\n  \\item Network-layer \\textbf{connectionless service}: packets are forwarded independently without determining each path statically. This involves only source and end components without maintaining path state information.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\textbf{Network-layer connection and connectionless services} in many ways parallel transport-layer connection-oriented and connectionless services.

Keeping state \nwould also be very complicated, because of the high complexity that so many connections would \nbring, and also for security reasons.\n\n\\section{Virtual circuit and datagram networks}\n\nComputer networks that provide only a connection service at the network layer are called \n\\textit{virtual-circuit (VC) networks}. A packet belonging to a virtual circuit at the network layer will have \nin its header. It uses connection switching, for network-layered connections, and is used much \nless frequently. It uses \\textit{VC number} rather than the full destination. The router stores the \nminimum connection state information for the ongoing connections (e.g forwarding state is kept \n\\textit{per connection}). The forwarding tables are populated by the connection setup:\nFrom Switch\nInterface\nnumber\n76 2\nFrom Switch\nInterface\nnumber\n76 2\n\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.2\\textwidth]{img.png}\n\\end{center}\nWhen Alice initiates a virtual circuit to Bob, and \nwants the network to guarantee minimum \nthroughput for the network flow. She first sets \nup the state and the forwarding tables at a subset \nof the routers (Fig. 8), when the virtual circuit is \nestablished end-to-end. Bob and Alice follow the \nsteps as they do for TCP switching. When an \napplication process starts at Alice, it informs the \nrouters it is creating a new connection and they \nmake an \\textit{\u201callocation\u201d}. This step requires \nrouting too. When a connection made through a certain output link (it figures out which \noutput link is possible through these routers), they set the allocation table entries to Bob, and \nreturn the mapping to the client. This VC number or setup packet is characterized by the fact that \na new VC number is used for every connection that goes through another router. The connection \ninterface has more manageable forwarding tables. When Alice then sends data to Bob, \nthese VC number in the header of every packet.\n\n\\subsection{Routing:}\n\nThe network layer use a short fixed-length VC number of 1 byte as it identifies that every VC \nis forwarded exclusively to each data forwarding packet with a new VC number. The new VC \nnumber 76 sets its forwarding table.\n\nThus, the network layer allow for this piece of the internet keep state information for every VC \nnumber routing with the internet. The datagram model, on the other hand, requests from millions of \ndevices out in the internet sending tons of datagrams, as a part of the IP-header.\n\nThe network layer use the internet doesn\u2019t provide any form of guarantee. It uses packet-based \ndelivery. The destination address is described as a \\textit{datagram} model. This became the forensic \nstep and separate from what provide the IP, the internet, each subnet independently. Routers and \nforwarding tables stores information about the IP-Address. For instance \u2013 IP routers don\u2019t\n\\newpage\n\n34 of 49",

When a source wants to send information to a certain destination, it writes the IP of the destination in the network-layer header of the packet. The router that receives the packet reads the IP and forwards it to the correct output link.\n\nTo reduce the amount of mappings to be kept in the forwarding tables of each router, forwarding tables hold what mappings from ranges of IPs to output links. To implement this, the network-layer uses a routing scheme called \\emph{longest-prefix matching}. This means that the routing table stores entries consisting of:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item subnet, whose ranges that aren't complete\n    \\item next hop to use if an IP of that range arrives.\n\\end{itemize}\nLet's take an example of a router (p), which is routing the range (0..3) and a specific entry IP-address is 0011. \n\\begin{table}[h!]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c |}\n    \\hline\n    dest. address range & Next-hop & Interface \\\\ \n    \\hline\n    0001* & 01* & 0 \\\\\n    001* & 010* & 1 \\\\\n    111* & 0000* & 2 \\\\\n    000000 & 1111* & 3 \\\\\n    101* & 1111* & 4 \\\\\n    1001 & 0111* & 5 \\\\\n    ... & 01111111 & 6 \\\\\n    011011* & ... & ... \\\\\n    * & ... & ... \\\\\n    ... & ... & ... \\\\\n    \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nWhen the router receives a packet with a certain address, it will look in its forwarding table and choose the entry with longest match to the destination IP.\n\n\\emph{To have ranges as homogenous and \u201ctidy\u201d as possible, it's important that end-systems that are physically close to one another have similar IPs, which means that the IP address themselves should be location-oriented.}\n\nThe diagram stores the address of the network (only) because it scales better (no need for per-host connection state), and it makes the network simpler (no need to store too many addresses).\n\nIP addresses are numbers from 0 to $2^{32}$, represented by 4 sets of bytes, written in their decimal form (from 0 to 255). An IP prefix is a range of IP addresses.\nIn this figure, the address 1.0.0.0/8 refers to the set of IPs that are matching the 8 most significant bits. The number of MSBs we will take from the IP address is called ``prefix size''. By knowing the corresponding prefix size and taking corresponding MSBs from an IP address, we can figure if an address belongs to a specified prefix range. Same is the case with the other prefixes where range is determined by the prefix. Another word: the \"prefix length\" is by writing the bit prefix, and then \"\\texttt{dot-star}\" (*), which means that from there the bits can be anything.\n\n35 of 49",
    "\\section{4.3: Routers}\n\nWhen Alice sends a packet to Bob, that packet crosses multiple packet switches: Some of them are link-layer switches, and some of them are network-layer switches (which are also called IP routers). Routers are made of two general parts : the control plane (routing, resource management) which is software, and the data plane (forwarding) which is hardware. Their main role is to move each packet towards its destination. The input ports also have some forwarding table copies and packet buffers. An input port performs the data link layer functions and sends the incoming physical signal to a router. It is also here that the forwarding table is consulted to determine the outer output port to which an arriving packet will be forwarded via the switching fabric. \\textit{The switching fabric connects the router\u2019s input ports to its output ports.}\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/router-internal.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\nAn output port stores packets received from the switching fabric and transmits these packets on the outgoing link by performing the necessary link-layer and physical-layer functions. The routing processor executes the routing protocols, maintains the routing tables and link state information, and computes the forwarding table. Control packets (e.g., packets used for the routing protocols, e.g., a router\u2019s IP address, port  number, and status) are also forwarded to the routing processor. The network management function (e.g., configuration, fault management, and logging) is also done in the routing processor.\n\nThe switch fabric stores all traffic of memory. In this case, input and output ports functioned as traditional I/O devices in a computer. Finally, there is \\textbf{interconnection} when the processor first signals the routing processor. The packet is then copied from the input port and processed without intervention. The packet is then forwarded and placed in the output port buffer. The packet is then put in the forwarding table, and copies the packet to the output port\u2019s buffers.",
    "\\textbf{Computer Networks \\hfill EPFL - Fall semester 2017}\n\nIf the memory bandwidth is such that 2R packets per second can be written into, or read from, memory, then the overall forwarding throughput must be less than R (because the data must be put into memory, and then taken out).\n\n\\textbf{Queuing delay} will occur in each of input ports, in the case where two packets coming in from two input queues destined for the same link arrive at the same moment. \nIn this case, assume the packets of the same size: one of the packets will be transmitted right away, while waiting for output port to free up.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{img.png}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\textbf{Head of line blocking} can happen when a switch is experiencing queuing delay, and a new packet gets forwarded to the switch while the queue is full or heavily blocked. In this case, the arriving packet experiences a delay, and the next queue becomes blocked.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{img1.png}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\section*{4.4: The Internet Protocol}\nThe world is organized in IP Subnets: that each has its own IP prefix. Informally, an IP Subnet is a network segment that does not include any router, built with hosts belonging to the same network. For subnets with the same prefix, that is, any IP Subnet, i.e. $11110000$ using one of the prefixes. Each router can also have an IP Subnet that it is built under. For example, the left subnet has all their IPs that aggregates to $11110000 00001111$. Each router can have an IP address from the prefix for that subnet, which means that subnets will need to have different preordained bits. Here are some example addressing layouts and subnets that help with ensuring correct addressing and that they are sorted to the correct address for each subnet they belong to.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{img2.png}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\tiny{37 of 49}",
    "Organisations obtain IP prefixes from its ISP or a regulatory body, and then a network operator assigns IP addresses to router interfaces manually, and to end-systems either manually or through DHCP (an automatic process).\n\nBecause there are only a finite number of IP addresses, it\u2019s possible that a network runs out of them, and that actually happens quite often. In that case, the network administrator cannot give any new IP address to a potential new user. The solution to this problem is to use private IP address spaces. A private IP address is one that is only meaningful inside the administrator\u2019s local network. This means that if a router outside of the local network sees the IP address, it won\u2019t recognize it.\n\nIn order to communicate with users outside of its local network, a user with a private IP address also needs to use NAT, the network address translation scheme addresses are private and of course never routed over the last part number. The router located at the border of the local network will choose an arbitrary large key, which it stores in the table, and uses the IP address of the host and the port number corresponding to a table we present in the figure. Because the IP address was initialized in figure \\ref{fig:network}, the NAT router replaces the private IP address from the source by a new IP address and increments the port number of the private IP address from the source and increments to the host. It\u2019s an example of what we call the application of the user by a software. \nWe conclude this chapter with a few key points. To begin with exercices in the domain to remind every reader that number is the correct TCP port number. That way when the destination responds, the host or server will use the same port number and same source IP address to send to the correct end-system to the network.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The router rewrites incoming packets\u2019 headers by replacing their source address/port numbers with the correct TCP port number.\n    \\item For incoming packets, regarding the source address are many to one replacements, usually router address translations are also performed.\n    \\item The router rewrites incoming destination address/port numbers with the correct end-system\u2019s private IP address and port number.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nA global IP address is the correct TCP request is a private IP for internet requests and as Figure~\\ref{fig:nat} implies, once the terminal receives a response11the replacement entry will be removed.\n\n\\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics{example.png}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\textbf{4.5: Routing Algorithms}\n\nWhether the network layer provides a datagram service with (in which case different packets between a given source-destination pair may take different routes) or a VC service (in which case all packets between a given source and destination pair will take the same path), the network layer must determine the route or path taken by packets as they flow from sender to receiver. In case of datagram networks, this job is done by the routing algorithms, the term adopting the routes that the packets take, thus to the first-hop router (referred to as the source), onto the outgoing link. Routing algorithms determine the path the entire network that the first take between sources to destination router. The problem of finding the path. We will then see that they can be grouped into two broad classes, routing, algorithms and dynamic algorithms. Routing, algorithms can be classified as static, routing. Here, check.  an edge and of. ",
    "routers, with links connecting the routers, a routing algorithm finds a \u201cgood\u201d (which usually means least-cost) path from source router to destination router.\n\nA network can be seen as a weighted graph with routers as vertices and links as edges. The goal of the least-cost path routing algorithm is to find the least-cost path from each source router to each destination router. In our version of the problem, we will only look at the cost of each link as a propagating delay. In reality, it\u2019s different.\n\n\\textbf{A global routing algorithm} computes the least-cost path between a source and destination using complete, global knowledge about the network. It takes as input the router graph and the link costs, and outputs the least-cost path from every router to every destination. In other words, this type of algorithm has exact information this information as if obtained by an omniscient observer. This is done by having each node broadcast link-state packets to all other nodes in the network, so that it knows everything about the nodes and links. A link-state algorithm is modular: first, it takes as input a graph that models the network and then it computes the best path to each link. It\u2019s a centralized algorithm. The calculation itself can be done with extreme simplicity, thanks to Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm. A global algorithm can also be intra-AS information and the algorithm uses a topology and cost of each link in the network.\n\nOne major global algorithm that can be used is \\textbf{Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm}. It computes the least-cost path from one node (the source) to all other nodes in the network using the network graph. It first computes, for each edge, the set of iterations of edges where two new nodes are in the tree and connects the nodes and iterates. This algorithm runs in time $O(n \\log n)$ where $n$ is the number of edges.\n\nIn a \\textbf{decentralized algorithm}, the calculation of the least-cost path is carried out in an iterative, distributed manner, in which no node has complete information about the cost of all network links. Instead, each node begins with only the knowledge of the costs of its own directly attached links; through an iterative process of calculation and exchange of information with its neighbouring nodes, a node gradually calculates the least-cost path to a destination or set of destinations. The decentralized algorithm we study is widely used and is known as the distance vector algorithm. The name distance-vector derives from the fact that each node, $x$, maintains a vector of costs. This vector of costs has one entry for each destination in the network that is, $D_x = [D_x(y) \\space \\text{for}\\space  y \\space \\in \\space Y]$, where $D_x(y)$ is the cost of the least-cost path from $x$ to $y$. In order to adapt changes in their network, nodes periodically broadcast their distance vector estimate to its neighbors. The algorithm is followed by the nodes until there is no more information exchange happening. The parts involved are:\n\n- nodes as routers \n- links connecting the routers \n- costs assigned as delays on the links\n\nThe basic idea for the propagation of information is as follows. Each node is given its \\(D(i)\\), an estimate of the cost of the least-cost path from itself to a destination node \\textit{d}. This distance-vector algorithm starts out with the tables mostly empty, but as neighbors transfer information the ",
    "Computer Networks \\hfill EPFL - Fall semester 2017\n\nanother they can fill out their tables, and update the distances from themselves to other nodes when they find better paths, and then propagate that information elsewhere.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{fig1.jpg}\n\\end{center}\n\nWhen looking for the distance at which an edge not directly connected to it is, the routing algorithm can use the Bellman-Ford equation. For this example, it\u2019s:\n\n\\[ \nd_{x}(y) = \\min \\{cost(x, n) + d_{n}(y)\\} \\quad \\forall \\, n \\text{ neighbors n} \n\\]\n\nWhen a node running the DV algorithm detects a change in the link cost from itself to a neighbor, it updates its distance vector, and if there\u2019s a change in the cost of the least-cost paths, it informs its neighbors of this new distance vector. In the chart that link 1 is deleted, the rest are updated. The node F updates its distance table, see the chart where it links to G for a distance 3. This last step updates information sent by F to A, and in this case, the distance is recomputed as in:\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{fig2.jpg}\n\\end{center}\n\nIt then informs A. However, there\u2019s a small bug in the algorithm normally. In theory 7 and 3. The node would loop infinitely in between 7 and 3. The solution is called \u201esetting infinity to a number with ceiling,\" if 16 then A would inform F. Then F would stop bouncing and would find out another path 5 found with distance update consistently till another path 3 is found with patience and finally, finding the shortest 3 as 1+2 and not \u201e7\u22d211\". So avoid the problem. We can use a poisoned reverse. With poisoned reverse, it will affect the update by F to A, where it will then try to send for the same link a value \u201einfinity meeting the conditions\" (i.e if d_{Z}(y), then distance as 1+2, it would tell this combination is more than alter). In utilization, if z reconnect y then update to x in y (and lets avoid doing so).\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{fig3.jpg}\n\\end{center}\n\n40 of 49",
    "Computer Networks \\hfill EPFL - Fall semester 2017\n\n4.6: Routing in the internet\n\nLink-state routing converges faster than distance-vector, but DV requires less messages. Between the two it\u2019s a tradeoff between convergence and message overhead. In the internet, the challenge is that LS would cost flooding, by sending too many messages to broadcast information; but DV would actually never converge. This is why the Internet chooses to use administrative autonomy. Each ISP can choose the routing protocol it wants. ISPs don\u2019t necessarily trust the least-cost routing, they may not want to adapt their link costs for that.\n\nThe Internet is separated in autonomous systems (AS). Each ISP has one or more autonomous systems in which it can use its specific intra-AS routing algorithm to be used. Each AS has a routing algo- rithm to forward packets inside the AS from one router to another, and learns how to reach different prefixes in the global internet: $d_{1}= B .X$, $d_{2}= C .Y$, and so on with a network prefix. In terms of routing from node to node (cost) but also to understanding the routes as in AS when the task deals of being responsible for forwarding packets to other routers as these routers are called gateway routers.\n\nTo connect routers between ASes, inter-domain routing is defined (BGP4). It\u2019s run by all Internet routers, and every router learns how to reach every foreign prefix. To do this, every router learns at least one router in each AS. The local router selects between the different gateway routers and shares the information with the routers. Adaptation messages never carry informa- tion about the least cost inside all other ASes.\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of ASes. The first, eBGP, carries packets in between ASes. The second, iBGP, carries information about subnets from another AS though a subset in its own AS.\n\n\\textbf{How does a decision route the inter-AS?} It\u2019s based on gateway step. Usually there is only one choice for each node and is not flooded even. Each router has one router per destination they know of. The details are: iBGP sends updates about prefixes to be announced and then ISPs as different routers send the information forward. The packet or the routers decide the best path to reach the next routers closest to the ultimate destination.\n\n\\textbf{41 of 49}",
    "Computer Networks \\hfill EPFL - Fall semester 2017\n\nWhen more than one gateway router is present, a router will make its choice based on a couple factors. First of all, it can choose to bypass some ASs (for example, if it doesn't have a good commercial relationship with the company managing it). Otherwise, it could also just choose to take the path that goes through the smallest number of ASs, or the path to the destination, whose routers are the fastest paid. There is no fixed protocol.\n\nThe solution to the problems caused by internet routing was to introduce hierarchy. To scale, an Internet router does not need to learn how to reach every other Internet router: it just needs to know every router in the local AS, and one router per foreign IP prefix.\n\n\\section*{Network Security}\nThere are a few security properties that can be important when transferring information on a network:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Confidentiality:} Only the sender and the receiver understand the contents of the message.\n    \\item \\textbf{Authenticity:} the message is from whom it claims.\n    \\item \\textbf{Integrity:} the message was not changed during transfer.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nTo maintain confidentiality, the end-users can use encryption and decryption algorithms. The classical encryption algorithm is the Caesar cipher, where every character of the plaintext is replaced by the character obtained by shifting 3 characters to the right in the alphabet. For example, ``Hello, world!'' becomes ``Khoor, zruog!''. The decryption algorithm takes as input the ciphertext, and shifts every character to the left. This manual method was used in ancient Egypt.\n\nIn symmetric key cryptography, the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the message. At its core, symmetric key cryptography generates ``random-looking'', scrambled versions of the plaintext and decrypts it using the same key and decryption algorithm.\n\nThe most commonly used modern ciphers: RC4, AES and Blowfish. This shortcut shows the \"strength\" of keys by the size they take to brute force. This is summarized by the term ``amount of keys to try out of hand''.\n\nIn \\textbf{asymmetric key cryptography} uses two key per user:\n$$ \n\\text{key } + \\text{key } = (\\text{plaintext}) = \\text{plaintext}\n$$\n$$ \n\\text{key } + \\text{key} = (\\text{plaintext}) = \\text{plaintext}\n$$",

In this scenario, Alice will encrypt the plaintext with Bob's public key (k$_{public}$) and leave. Bob is the only one to know his private key (k$_{private}$) and is the only person able to decrypt the message. It's important that with the \"key\", it impossible to find \"key\". The challenge for asymmetric key cryptography is that it's computationally expensive. There needs to be sophisticated encryption/decryption algorithms, such as RSA or DSA.\n\nTo conclude, symmetric key cryptography is faster but asymmetric key cryptography doesn't require out of band key sharing. Confidentiality can be achieved through both systems.\n\nA cryptographic hash function maps a large input to a smaller output. The hash shouldn't reveal any information about the input. It should also be very difficult to find two input that produce the same hash. With this service, it guarantees that the file/input is not manipulated. The sender computes the hash of the input, and then inputs the hash to the receiver to recover the plaintext.\n\nThe first and most important goal of authenticity in symmetric key cryptography is accomplished through MAC (Message Authentication Code). Alice will compute the hash of the input and then encrypt it with the shared secret key. The input and the hash are both sent to Bob (k$_{private}$). Bob will apply the same hashing function on the input and the hash of the message with the secret key and compare that with the received MAC. If both values are equal, Bob can conclude that Alice sent the message.\n\n\\begin{verbatim}\n\\matrix\n{\\text{plain text} & |\\ k_{private} \\quad |\\ c_{private} & \\smash{\\Rightarrow} & \\text{plain text} \\\\\n\\text{plain text} & |\\ k_{public} \\quad |\\ c_{public} & \\smash{\\Rightarrow} & \\text{plain text} \\\\\n\\text{plain text} & |\\ k_{public} \\quad |\\ c _{private} & \\smash{\\Rightarrow} & \\text{cipher text}}\n\\end{verbatim}\n\n\\begin{verbatim}\n\\matrix\n{\\text{plain text: 'open'} & k_{public}\\rightarrow & \\text{cipher text: '54E65\\ldots'A44} \\\\\n\\text{cipher text: '54E65\\ldots'A44} & k_{public}\\quad|\\ k_{private}\\rightarrow & \\text{plain text: 'open'}}\n\\end{verbatim}\n\n\\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{SymmetricKey.png}\n\\end{center}\n\nWith both of these services, anyone can replay the message sent and then resend it some time later.

It\u2019s randomly generated by Bob, and is only valid for a given amount of time, which depends on the type of interaction that\u2019s going on between Alice and Bob. This will also avoid the replay of an old message, and prevent Tries from just replaying the message, and thus just redoding timing information. This would be called a replay attack. Alice appends, depending on the type of authentication used, either\n$$ k_{key} = \\text{hash(dataE;nonce|message)} $$\nor\n$$ \\text{hash(dataE;Key1nonce|message)} $$\n\nBecause even slightly modifying a message will modify the hash (into a random hash function), integrity can be provided the same way as authenticity.\n\nMan in the middle attack: If the attacker Manuel will sit on the network between Alice and Bob, he will be able to read all the messages that both send.

And Alice will have Bob\u2019s public key: the then will start the Diffie-Hellman key establishment this Alice will have his Bob\u2019s public key. But this allows Ben to verify public-keys. The solution to this is to have public key certificates, signed by a certificate authority (CA), generally recognized by a web sower. Certificates also generally have an expiration date. The certificate will link the public key to its identity e.g. \"Bob\" and is generally denoted as:\n$$ C_Bob = \\{ \\text{Bob,s public key},{t,s\\_sig} \\} $$\nThis means the key is digitally signed by the CA:\n\nSo, there could be a photograph of the public key in their browser.

As mentioned, we know that the network layer packets a packet from the \\textit{network layer} from its destination. As soon as the link layer has received an IP packet, it can then transfer it to the next destination host, until it's moved over each individual link to the destination host. \nConsider a home network. A home network consists of several devices connected to a switch/router. If you access the internet in a link-layer network, this Figure shows the \\textit{link layer} network and how internet is accessed. The router is a gateway to the network, and it might connect to another home/computer network or to the office, a business network, or any device that wants to connect to the internet.\n\n\\includegraphics{Link_Layer.png}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{Link_Layer.png}\n\\caption{\\textit{Link Layer Network}}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n45 of 49",
    "Computer Networks \\hspace{2pt} \\hfill EPFL - Fall semester 2017\n\nThe basic service of any link layer is to move a datagram from one node to an adjacent node over a single communication link, but the details of the provided service can vary from one link-layer protocol to the next. Possible services that can be offered by a link-layer protocol include:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item[I.] Framing. Almost all link-layer protocols encapsulate each network-layer datagram within a link-layer frame before transmission over the link. A frame consists of a data field, in which the network-layer datagram is inserted, and a number of header fields. The structure of the frame is specified by the link-layer protocol.\n    \\item[II.] Link access. A medium access control (MAC) protocol specifies the rules by which a frame is transmitted onto the link. For point-to-point links that have a single sender on one end of the link and a single receiver at the other end of the link, the MAC protocol is simple (or nonexistent). For broadcast links (such as the Ethernet links in Figure \\ref{fig:LAN}), a MAC protocol is needed to specify the rules by which frames are transmitted onto the link. Here, the MAC protocol serves to coordinate the frame transmissions of the many nodes.\n    \\item[III.] Reliable delivery. When a link-layer protocol provides reliable delivery service, it guarantees to move each network-layer datagram across the link without error. Recall that certain transport-layer protocols also provide a reliable delivery service (see Chapter 3). Similar to a transport-layer reliable delivery service, a link-layer reliable delivery service is achieved with acknowledgments and retransmissions. A link-layer reliable delivery can be important for links with high error rates or that go through harsh environments.\n    \\item[IV.] Error detection and correction. Reliable delivery also plays a role in this class of services, but it is concerned primarily with detecting errors in the transmitted frames and correcting them. Error detection is done using a CRC code (see Chapter 5), which adds a small amount of redundancy to the transmitted data. If the received frame contains errors, the check fails, and the error detection mechanism must request the sender to retransmit the frame.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe link-layer\u2019s role is to take a packet across from one device to the next device, typically, inside one IP-Subnet. The network-layer takes over to send the packets to the ultimate destination-end systems across the entire network, through\n \\[\\] \n\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{LAN.png}",
    "\\textbf{multiple IP-Subnets.} Hosts and routers have link-layer addresses, called \\textbf{MACs}. This address is 6 bytes long, giving $2^{48}$ possible MAC addresses. These 6-byte addresses are typically expressed in hexadecimal notation, with each byte of the address expressed as a pair of hexadecimal numbers. MAC addresses were designed to be permanent \\textit{(it is said that a burned-in ROM will typically have that same address)}. One interesting property of MAC addresses is that two network adapters never share the same address \\textit{(the IEEE manages the MAC address space)}. MAC addresses have a flat structure as opposed to the hierarchical structure of IP addresses) and don\u2019t change when you move the adapter. A laptop with an Ethernet interface and a WiFi interface will have two different link addresses for the two interfaces. When an adapter wants to send a frame to some destination adapter, the sending adapter inserts the destination adapter\u2019s MAC address into the frame header.\n\\\\\n\\\\\nBecause there are both network-layer addresses \\textit{(for example, Internet IP addresses)} and link-layer addresses \\textit{(that is, MAC addresses)}, there is a need to translate between both. This job is done by a protocol, the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), that acts as translator from IP addresses to MAC addresses. In many ways it is analogous to DNS, which resolve host names to IP addresses, except that ARP resolves between the same hosts at the data link layer. Because ARP is dynamic, it avoids the configuration challenge of fixed translation tables. Take a look at ARP in action in this simple scenario: when an IP datagram has to MAC addresses and vice-versa on need to be transformed to a run on the same LAN, the first step of the sender is to check if the ARP table already contains an entry for this MAC address bound to this IP. If it does, the job is already done, and the sender can use the MAC address from the table to prepare the frame and send it on its way.\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNow suppose that the sender node did not contain the desired IP-address-to-MAC address in its ARP table. In this case, the sender uses the ARP protocol to resolve the address. As the diagram in Figure 5.26 places out, the sender constructs an ARP Packet, which has the target\u2019s IP address. As customary for Ethernet, the sender sends the frame to the Ethernet broadcast address \\textit{(FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF)}. This means that the Packet is delivered to all connected adapters on the particular LAN, and so all nodes will have to generate an interrupt to at least have the adapter read the frame. The sending adapter\u2019s ARP-and receiving IP- address. A reply with MAC, which is then the specific this ARP request included the Internet frame. Again the sender stores the IP--MAC address pair in its ARP table, and can now use it for future packets. Notice that it is a simple purpose of the ARP request packet is to query all the other hosts and routers in the LAN to filter up to to the target IP address and return its MAC address Now that the sender has the receiver\u2019s MAC address. It can go ahead and pass the data to the link layer, which combines the sender\u2019s data with the MAC addresses of the sender and the receiver into a frame, encapsulating the data as the Protocol Data Unit (PDU) and transmits it using the proper signaling over the Ethernet.\n\\\\\n\\\\\nARP tables get built automatically\u2014they don\u2019t have to be configured by a system administrator. If a host boots up connected to the LAN, it sends out an ARP query to build up its table. Hence, ARP tables are dynamic and with a limited lifetime so to keep them current, it is possible to update certain MAC addresses. When they receive a packet with some MAC address in the header with.",
    "Computer Networks \\hfill EPFL - Fall semester 2017\n\n\\textbf{The switch adds to its table the fact that packets with destination MAC addresses x needs to be forwarded through link y. When a packet with an unknown MAC address arrives at a switch, it broadcasts a message to learn where it needs to forward it. Thus the self-learning relies on actual traffic. If the tables were pre-filled manually, they wouldn\u2019t update bounds.} \\\\\n\\\\\nARP uses hubs to realize communication. All nodes can be part of, but not necessarily all edges. An edge is not trusted if it doesn\u2019t involve exchange nodes. The traffic is thereby broadcasted/forwarded on the mesh which prevents infinite loops. This means that some specific nodes are designated data playing (DP) and some root ports (RP). \\\\\n\\\\\nThe link layer was designed for flexibility, while the network layer was designed for scalability. There are usually three types of hierarchy here: \\\\\n1. IP Switches: Use link-layer(L2) forwarding, self-learning and broadcasting. \\\\\n2. Routers: Use hop-by-hop (L3) forwarding intra-domain (usually L3 routing prefixes). \\\\\n3. Ethernet switches: Use link-layer (L2) intra-domain (distance-vector IPB) routing. \\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{Now, an example. What happens when Alice sends a packet with their IP address?} \\\\\nSuppose they're directly set with ARP packets as being at the local LAN level and four packets are generated as in the figure below:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item DNS server request\n\\item Alice's ISC request to local DNS server\n\\item Local DNS server's response to A\n\\item ISC request is repeated so A will have vTVB$^{ast.messagebox}$ cache to server\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\\\\n\\textbf{So how about when packets are transmitted along the links to the correct destination?}\\\\\nIf a host H in subnet A1 wants to send to an IP-unicast via the DNS request, a host switching transport network layers. It will learn to serve IP/Alice's IP addresses, and domain names, embedded in the L2 table. The DNS server identifiers are global, but within A1's subnet will get the ISC caching table update of the DNS cache. If the packet arrives at S1 switch, Alice's ARP packets are set in the L2 table as a specific cache memory. The L2 table switch detects the mac addresses at a given IP server to see how and where. It broadcasts to learn this bind because the MAC binds with the DNS server \\ldots. \n\n$10.42.78.240$ sends an ARP request to map Alice's ISC user $00c707d2c17e\\#$. The DNS server is the table of A2 cache switches the server is L1/ADN/ws* when the local cache of server's MAC address. The DNS server will respond with the IP network. This process, in configuration, sends the correct packet to a testing pool if H sends A's request, it will push the packet through to the server.\n",
    "II. The DNS server extracts the DNS query message and determines the IP address linked to it (either it's already in its cache, or he uses DNS to find it). He then responds to Alice directly (if has her MAC address, because she sent the request to him).\n\nIII. Alice performs the HTTP GET request, which is passed down to the link layer again, after having the right headers added, which will send on an ARP request to retrieve the web server's MAC address. Router R1 will respond at the request with his MAC address, because the DNS server is not in Alice's IP Subnet. Alice will then send the packet to router R1, who upon receiving it will transfer it to its le next layer, and it will determine that R1 is responsible for that IP prefix through its routing table, but is connected to it first. Upon receiving the packet, R1 will send an ARP broadcast request that in turn will determine the server's MAC address. The web server will respond. When it has it, it will pass the packet through the web server. The server will then receive the HTTP GET request, and answer with the web page.\n\nIV. The server already has Alice's MAC and IP address, so the packet will just be forwarded through the same route Alice's packet arrived.",

This is the reason why it is called \"Naive\" Bayes.\n\n\\subsection*{Q2.2:}\nIn text classification, preprocessing is really crucial in order to allow a \"good\" representation mainly through proper lexical variability reduction.\n\nUsual NLP steps for reducing lexical variability include: tokenization (separating word tokens), PoS tagging, lemmatization, replacement of grammatical/\u201cmeaningless\u201d/words (stopword, some PoS tagging).\n\nIf lemmatization is not possible, stemming could be considered either.\n\nWe could also have a more advanced tokenizer including Entity Recognition (e.g. based on regular expressions) to ensure Entity Recognition for Proper Nouns, etc.\n\n\\subsection*{Q2.3:}\nI constructed and used my own lexicon for this need based on:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item 3 freely licensed online available wordlists.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\noindent Here example Python code to build the lexicon:\n\\begin{verbatim}\nlexicon = set() \nfor filename in os.listdir('lexicons'): \n  with open('lexicons/'+filename) as f: \n  lexicon.update(set([line.lower() for line in f])) \n\\end{verbatim}\nOnce the lexicon is created, I computed indices (this was not expected as an alternative for Q4.2)!\n\n\\begin{verbatim}\n# Since the root words are: [bowl, 8], [1],[oneoneone],[8]\nw = [1., 1.8, oneoneone...] \nn = [8,8,8,bowl,...] \nbowls = set([i for i in above_indexed_words]) \nlex_mapping = lexicon.difference(bowls) \n\\end{verbatim}\n\n\\subsection*{Q2.4:}\nThis lexicon construction is specific to the above described tasks. We should apply this independently on each training set/test set.\n\nOtherwise some external (a priori non-labeled dataset) would be build, the role of the lexicon being to \"standardize/propagate\" a-priori knowledge and increase lexicon coverage.\n\nThe choice of such a lexicon thus highly depends on the size of the vocabulary to be stored (and tagged accordingly) and its final usable form:\n\nAuxiliary lexicon and partwise layer level necessary.\n\nExample for the above wrongly written memory (whenever it is meaningless):\n\\begin{itemize}\n\t\\item ai 123454 is the branching of array1 with that ARRAY!!! => [123454.8\u2026] 50 codes.\n\\end{itemize}\nIt should be noted that the probability array is very likely to be very sparse.

Notice also that the sets of indexing features are \\textbf{set}$_I$ and that therefore any notice of word order is lost after the indexing phase.\n\nFor example, if we consider the toy document collection consisting of the two following documents:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item[]\n\\underline{D1:} \"The results of the experiments on transgenic plants will be issued soon\"\n\\item[]\n\\underline{D2:} \"As soon as the experiments will be over, the laboratory will issue a report.\"\n\\end{itemize}\n\nA possible output of the indexing phase for these documents might be: \n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item[]\nD1 $\\rightarrow$ \\{result, experiment, transgenic, plant, issue\\}\n\\item[]\nD2 $\\rightarrow$ \\{soon, experiment, laboratory, close, issue\\}\n\\end{itemize}\n\nBut it is important to notice that the order of the word lemmas in the indexing sets is in fact irrelevant. D1 and D2 might be equivalently indexed by:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item[]\nD1 $\\rightarrow$ \\{experiment, plant, issue, result, transgenic\\}\n\\item[]\nD2 $\\rightarrow$ \\{experiment, close, issue, laboratory, soon\\}\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe whole process of the vector semantic modeling is the representation phase.\n\nDuring this phase, each document from the initial corpus is represented, after the indexing phase, as a point in a multidimensional space. Notice here that what makes the dimensionality of this space is the number of features in the indexing sets.\n\nA \\textbf{word vector space model} (WVSM) in which the $i^{th}$ coordinate simply indicates the presence or the absence of the corresponding indexing feature is not a very efficient representation. As the following indexing sets illustrate:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item[]\nD3 = \\{a\\}\n\\item[]\nD4 = \\{ the, it\\}\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe actual distribution of the terms in a text, however, is much more informative. An appropriate weighting scheme can therefore simply consist of weighting the occurrences of the indexing features according to their frequency. A different value for each term or feature is assigned depending on the term or feature frequency. \\(f_{i,j}\\) indicates the absolute frequency of the feature \\(i\\) for the documents \\(D_j\\). The weighted scheme can be expressed as follows:\n\n\\[\nTF_{i,j} = \\frac{f_{i,j}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{n} f_{k,j}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(TF_{i,j}\\) denotes the normalized frequency of the indexing feature space or term in the document. Comparing D3 and D4 in this feature space representation would then result in drastic changes.\nThe semantic proximity between D1 and D2 is simply defined as:\n\n\\[\nS(D1, D2)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nTF_{i,j} = \\frac{f_{i,j}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{n} f_{k,j}}\n\\]",

A weighted dot-product of the form:}\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d_i \\cdot W \\cdot d_j}{|| d_i || \\cdot || d_j ||} \\text{ with } W = (w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n)\n\\]\n\n\\textit{and usually W is taken as:}\n\n\\[\nw_{k} = \\frac{1}{df(t_k)}\n\\]\n\n\\textit{where $df(t_k)$ denotes the, as above (usually positive) coefficients.

    "\\noindent\n\\textbf{7.2} One of the important limitations of the standard vector space approach is that the use of the cosine-similarity imposes that the dimensions of the vector space are orthogonal and that therefore the indexing features associated with the dimensions have, by construction, a null mutual similarity.\n\n\\bigskip\n\nThis is in fact a problem as it is extremely difficult to guarantee that the indexing features associated with the dimensions are indeed semantically fully uncorrelated. For instance, it may well happen that two indexing features (e.g. \u201cto bake\u201d and \u201ccake\u201d) have very close information (that of \u201ccakes\u201d, which is conveyed to a mixture of the terms \u201cto bake\u201d and \u201ccake\u201d), while being indexed into orthogonal dimensions.\n\n\\bigskip\n\nA \u201cpossible\u201d partial solusion for this problem is to use more sophisticated representation techniques that exploit the Distributional Semantics (DS).\n\n\\bigskip\n\nIn short, the core idea of the indexing feature does not rely on the relations features-dimensions. Similarity between documents is thus not detected by comparing distances working within a single space, but rather between two spaces of potentially very dissimilar dimensions (e.g. two documents having a very close similarity score by vectors operating in spaces of dimensions).

I am based on the GPT-4 architecture, developed by OpenAI. The GPT series of models, including GPT-3 and GPT-4, are designed to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on given prompts, such as instructions or questions.\n\nThese models can understand and respond to a wide range of requests, including providing explanations for their responses. However, it is important to note that AI language models like GPT-4 are not perfect and can sometimes generate incorrect or incomplete information. As AI continues to evolve, newer and more advanced models will likely become even better at following instructions and providing accurate explanations.",

Try to use as many complicated words as possible.\n    \\item Explain the causes of world war I to a 10-year old\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The causes of World War I can be traced back to several factors, including imperialism, nationalism, and the intricate alliance system of the time. Imperialism, the practice of powerful nations exerting economic and political influence over weaker territories, created a simmering tension between the major powers. As European nations scrambled to colonize various parts of the world, their greed and ambition inevitably led to conflicts and rivalries. Nationalism also played a significant role, as the fervent sense of pride and loyalty to one's nation-state encouraged conflict over territorial and economic dominance.\n\n    \\item The complex network of treaties and alliances between countries was another crucial factor. France, Russia, and Britain formed an alliance known as the Triple Entente, opposed by the Central Powers, consisting of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. This alliance system meant that any conflict between two nations could quickly escalate into a full-scale war, drawing multiple countries into the fray.\n\n    \\item At the heart of the growing conflict was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by a Serbian nationalist in 1914. This act served as the immediate catalyst for war, triggering a series of declarations and mobilizations. The inability of European powers to resolve their differences diplomatically, coupled with the existing tensions and alliance commitments, ultimately led to the outbreak of World War I. The resulting conflict saw unprecedented levels of destruction and loss of life, shaping the course of history for generations to come. \n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item World War I was a big war that started in 1914 and lasted until 1918. It was fought between many countries, including Britain, France, and Russia on one side, and Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire on the other side.\n\n    \\item The main cause of World War I was a disagreement between countries over who was in charge of certain territories and the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by a member of a Serbian nationalist group. This led to a chain of events that eventually led to the start of the war.\n\n    \\item Another factor that contributed to the start of the war was the military alliances between countries. Some countries had made agreements to support each other in case of an attack, which meant that once one country got involved in the war, others were quickly pulled in as well.\n\n    \\item In short, World War I was caused by a combination of factors, including political and military tensions, territorial disputes, and alliances between countries that made it more likely for a small conflict to escalate into a large-scale war.\n\\end{itemize}",

The little boy is wearing a black zip up jacket and is holding his fingers to his lips to act like eating. A metal napkin dispenser is in between them at the table. There is a napkin in front of the girl. Two adults are on the other side of the booth. The room has white circular lights on the ceiling and a large window in the front of the restaurant. It is daylight outside.\n\n(Karpathy & Li, CVPR 2015)\n\n(Donahue et al., CVPR 2017)",

L'un des objets est le probl\u00e8me de trouver d'abord un i d\u00e9fini sur cette liste d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments (par exemple une instruction ou une position) la notable performance est proportionnelle au nombre des donn\u00e9es $N$. La r\u00e9ponse intuitive est de s'attendre au temps de recherche \u00e9tant de l'ordre de $N$. Cela requ\u00e9rait une exploration exhaustive : encore les \u00e9l\u00e9ments un par un jusqu'\u00e0 trouver l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment cherch\u00e9. De fa\u00e7on \u00e9tonnante, il est possible de faire cette recherche en $O(\\sqrt{N})$, beaucoup plus rapide qu'en classique. L'algorithme de Grover est la meilleure recherche possible dans le mod\u00e8le quantique, et son optimalit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e. La complexit\u00e9 quadratique de l'algorithme ne change pas par une approche en toute course compagnie.\n\nRegardons \u00e0 nouveau la recherche classique : par cette fa\u00e7on expectable mais sont rare que par tr\u00e8s approche g\u00e9niale.

You cannot list them all... so we need a way to say: if you give me an integer, I can tell you whether it's in the set or not. Is what we will call a \\emph{characteristic function}.\n\nMathematically, we can define the function which takes an integer as argument and yields a boolean indicating whether the given integer belongs to a set. We can define a set by its \\emph{characteristic function} (or \\emph{indicator function}): \n\n$$\nx \\in set \\Leftrightarrow set(x) = true\n$$\n\nFor example, we can define the set of all negative integers by its characteristic function and define a type alias for this representation:\n\n\\begin{verbatim}\ntype FunSet = Int => Boolean\n\\end{verbatim}\n\nWith this representation, we define a function that tests for the presence of a value in a set:\n\n\\begin{verbatim}\ndef contains(s: FunSet, elem: Int): Boolean = s(elem)\n\\end{verbatim}\n\n2.1 BASIC FUNCTIONS ON SETS",
    "Let's start by implementing basic functions on sets.\n\n1. Define a function which creates a singleton set from one integer value: the set represents the set of the one given element. Its signature is as follows:\n\\begin{verbatim}\ndef singletonSet(elem: Int): FunSet\n\\end{verbatim}\n\nNow that we have a way to create singleton sets, we want to define a function that allows us to build bigger sets from smaller ones.\n\n2. Define the functions union, intersect, and diff, which take two sets, and return, respectively, their union, intersection and differences. diff(s, t) returns a set which contains all the elements of the set s that are not in the set t. These functions have the following signatures:\n\\begin{verbatim}\ndef union(s: FunSet, t: FunSet): FunSet\ndef intersect(s: FunSet, t: FunSet): FunSet\ndef diff(s: FunSet, t: FunSet): FunSet\n\\end{verbatim}\n\n3. Define the function filter which selects only the elements of a set that are accepted by a given predicate p. The filtered elements are returned as a new set. The signature of filter is as follows:\n\\begin{verbatim}\ndef filter(s: FunSet, p: Int => Boolean): FunSet\n\\end{verbatim}\n\n\\subsection*{2.2 Queries and Transformations on Sets}\n\nIn this part, we are interested in functions used to make requests on elements of a set. The first function tests whether a set contains a given element or if all elements of the set. This forall function has the following signature:\n\\begin{verbatim}\ndef forall(s: FunSet, p: Int => Boolean): Boolean\n\\end{verbatim}\n\nNote that there is no direct way to find which elements are in a set, contains only allows to know whether a given element is included in a set. We wish to be able to determine if all elements of a set, between given bounds, satisfy a given predicate p. Because sets are represented as functions and, as to do something with it, Here, we consider that in integer has the property -1000\n-1000 We are now in the range  to limit the search space.\n\n\\paragraph{Hint.} Quantifiers can be expressed with recursion. For this, use a helper function nested in forall. Its structure is as follows (replace the ???):\n\\begin{verbatim}\ndef forall(s: FunSet, p: Int => Boolean): Boolean = {\n  def iter(a: Int): Boolean = {\n    if (???) ???\n    else if (???) ???\n    else iter(???)\n  }\n  iter(???)\n}\n\\end{verbatim}",
    "2. Using \\texttt{forall}, implement a function \\texttt{exists} which tests whether a set contains at least one element on which the given prediate is true. Note that the functions \\texttt{forall} and \\texttt{exists} behave like the universal and existential quantifiers of first-order logic.\n\n\\begin{verbatim}\ndef exists(P: Int => Boolean): Boolean\n\\end{verbatim}\n\n3. Finally, write a function \\texttt{map} which transforms a given set into another one by applying to each of its elements the given function. \\texttt{map} has the following signature:\n\n\\begin{verbatim}\ndef map(s: FunSet, f: Int => Int): FunSet\n\\end{verbatim}\n\n\\textbf{EXTRA HINTS}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Sets are represented as functions. Think about what it means for an element to belong to a set, in terms of function evaluation. For example, how do you represent a set that contains all numbers between 1 and 1000?\n\\item Most of the solutions for this assignment can be written as one-liners. If you have more, you probably need to rethink your solution. In other words, this assignment needs more thinking (whiteboard, pen and paper) than coding ;-).\n\\item If you are having some trouble with terminology, have a look at the \\texttt{glossary}.\n\\end{itemize}",

In this encoding, a number $n$ is represented by a function that maps any function $f$ to its $n$-fold composition.\n\nFor example, $1$, $2$, and $3$ are represented as follows:\n\\begin{verbatim}\n    def one  = (f => (x => f(x)))\n    def two  = (f => (x => f(f(x))))\n    def three= (f => (x => f(f(f(x)))))\n\\end{verbatim}\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Question 1.1}\n\nGive an implementation of the \\texttt{succ} function that takes a Church numeral and returns its successor.\n\nFor example, \\texttt{succ zero} evaluates to the definition of one and \\texttt{succ (succ zero)} evaluates to the definition of two.\n\n\\vspace{0.5cm}\n\\textbf{Question 1.2}\n\nGive an implementation of the \\texttt{add} function that takes two Church numerals and returns their sum, using \\texttt{succ}.\n\n\\vspace{1cm}\n\\subsection*{QUESTION 2}\nIn this exercise, you will be working with Church-encoded lists.\n\nMuch like Church numerals, Church-encoded lists are a representation of lists using only functions.\n\nA list is encoded as a function that takes a function \\texttt{cons} (to construct list elements) and returns the first one if the list is empty or applies the function again on the rest of the list until the list is non-empty.\n\nFor example, the list \\texttt{1,2,3} would be represented in this encoding as follows:\n\\begin{verbatim}\n    cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 (cons zero)))\n\\end{verbatim}\n\n\\vspace{0.5cm}\nIn this encoding, list decomposition is achieved by ``applying'' the list to a pair of continuations, one for the empty case and one for the non-empty case.

The motion of any rigid body can be represented as the motion of the center of mass, plus a rotation about the center of mass. In problem set 6, we found the position of the center of mass after the collision to be\n\n\\begin{equation}\nR_{\\text{cm}}(t) = \\frac{M_1 R_1 + M_2 R_2}{M_1 + M_2}.\n\\end{equation}\n\nHowever, to completely specify the motion of the particle-rod system, we must also calculate the rotational motion about the center of mass of the combined object. To do so, we first calculate the angular momenta of the two colliding masses just before the collision. There are two contributions to the angular momentum about the center of mass (one due to external torques acting on the system, and one called the spin about the center of mass):\n\n\\begin{equation}\nL_{\\text{ext}} = r_p \\times P_p = r_p \\times Mv_p\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere the subscript ``p'' indicates that the quantity is evaluated just before the collision and the subscript ``g'' indicates that the quantity refers to the center of mass of the system. The general form for the angular momentum of an object rotating about a fixed center of mass is given by\n\n\\begin{equation}\nL_{\\text{cm}} = \\sum_i r_i \\times m_i v_i = \\sum_i r_i \\times m_i (\\omega \\times r_i) = \\sum_i m_i r_i^2 \\omega = I_{\\text{cm}} \\omega,\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere the subscript ``i'' indicates the particle. Note that there are no torques due to the interactions between particles because $F_{ij} = -F_{ji}$. Immediately after the collision, at some later time $t$, the two particles rotate around the center of mass with a common velocity $v_i = \\omega \\times r_i$. The point to emphasize is that the angular momentum of the thing is the same just before and just after the collision. In particular,\n\n\\begin{equation}\nL_{\\text{ext}} = MR_{\\text{cm}} \\times \\dot{R}_{\\text{cm}}.\n\\end{equation}\n\nAfter the collision, the rod rotates like a rigid body about its center of mass. There is a common angular velocity $\\omega$ of the two particles. The angular momentum of such a rotating extended object (rigid body) is given by\n\n\\begin{equation}\nL_{\\text{cm}} = I_{\\text{cm}} \\omega,\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $I_{\\text{cm}}$ is the moment of inertia of rod with respect to center of mass. Substituting equations (1), (3), and (5) into equation (4), we get\n\n\\begin{equation}\nL_{\\text{ext}} = (M_1 + M_2)R_{\\text{cm}} \\times \\omega.\n\\end{equation}\n\nThis is almost what we want, but we still need $I_{\\text{cm}}$. To calculate it, we note that\n\n\\begin{equation}\nI_{\\text{cm}} = \\int_{\\alpha L}^{\\beta L} dm\\,r^2\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere the integral is taken over the entire mass of the combined object. Because integrals are just sums for continuous systems, this can be written (discretely) as iterations:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nI_{\\text{cm}} = \\sum_i m_i r_i^2 = \\int_{\\alpha L}^{\\beta L} \\rho\\,dx\\,x^2.\n\\end{equation}",

The rod is not at rest as it does not have a stable center, instead for $v_{CM}$, we find a $d < l$. $\\Rightarrow$ solving for $\\vec{r}_{CM}$ as $ \\underset{\\delta \\, do(t) \\cdot k}{\\lim}$ leaving,\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\langle v_{CM}i(t) \\rangle = \\frac{E_k}{v^2_{CM}\\mathcal{2B}} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\sum_{f} \\| F_{net}\\alpha l \\, dt\\|^2 = k - b^2 \\tag{11}\n\\end{equation}\n\\bigskip\nThus, substituting equation (10) yields,\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\vec{v}_{CM}(t) = \\frac{L}{m_r} \\; R_o \\tag{12}\n\\end{equation}\n\nand thus finding the initial equations\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\vec{R_i}(t) = \\frac{\\ell \\; k}{mr} =  R_o \\ell_f t^{3/2} k + 2 \\tag{13}\n\\end{equation}\n\\smallskip\n\\hfill 3",
    "PHYS-101(era) \\hfill Momentum, impulse, center of mass - Solutions to Problem Set 6\n\n\\begin{center}\n3. Two particles colliding\n\\end{center}\n\nWe will start by choosing a coordinate system with the origin defined to be the location of $m_1$ at $t = t_{col}$. This choice is sensible as we will then know that\n\\begin{equation}\nX_{\\text{CM}}(t_{col}) = \\frac{m_1 X_1(t_{col}) + m_2 X_2(t_{col})}{m_1 + m_2} = 0. \\tag{1}\n\\end{equation}\nSo the position of the CM will be identical to the distance traveled since $t = t_{col}$ (which is what the problem asks us to calculate). Additionally we note that the problem is one-dimensional, so we will only need to consider the $x$ coordinate.\n\nIn an inertial reference frame, we believe to be two-particle system, we have that the linear momentum is given by:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\vec{P}_{\\text{total}} = m_1 \\vec{V}_1 + m_2 \\vec{V}_2 \\tag{2}\n\\end{equation}\nSince there are no external forces on the two-particle system, we must have that the problem statement gives us the following definition of the center of mass\n\\begin{equation}\n\\vec{P}_{\\text{total}} = (m_1 + m_2) \\vec{V}_{\\text{CM}} \\Rightarrow \\vec{V}_{\\text{CM}} = \\frac{m_1 V_1 + m_2 V_2}{m_1 + m_2}. \\tag{3}\n\\end{equation}\nNote also, though the system is one-dimensional, we first work in vectors since it is important because the problem statement gives directions of the forces ---\n\\begin{equation}\n\\vec{X}_{\\text{CM}}(t) = \\vec{0} + \\vec{V}_{\\text{CM}} \\cdot (t - t_{col}). \\tag{4}\n\\end{equation}\nSince the total linear momentum is constant, we know that the center of mass position is linear in time. We therefore start solving the problem in coordinate system $x$:\n\\begin{equation}\nX_{\\text{CM}} = \\frac{m_1 x_1 + m_2 x_2}{m_1 + m_2} = X_{\\text{CM}}(t_{col}) + V_{\\text{CM}}(t - t_{col}), \\tag{5}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere we have taken the arbitrary constant in time integration to be $X_{\\text{CM}}(t_{col}) = 2$, which yields the convenient axis we saw used before in Eqs. 3, 4.\nNow if we look at the position of the center of mass as the trajectory acquired, we see that\n\\begin{equation}\nX_{\\text{CM}} = \\frac{m_1 x_1 + m_2 x_2}{m_1 + m_2} = V_{\\text{CM}}(t - t_{col}). \\tag{6}\n\\end{equation}\nTo illustrate that the choice was good for our calculations, let us put the earlier definitions into:\n\\begin{equation}\nX_{\\text{CM}, \\text{after}}(t) = V_{\\text{CM}}(t - t_{col}), \\tag{7}\n\\end{equation}\nand put the earlier definition of the center of mass from equation (3). The results from the problem statement will allow us to find a form with the initial speeds $V_{1i}$ and $V_{2i}$: solving this equation\n\\begin{equation}\nX_{\\text{CM}, \\text{after}}(t) = V_{\\text{CM}}(t - t_{col}) = \\frac{m_1 V_{1i} + m_2 V_{2i}}{m_1 + m_2}. \\tag{8}\n\\end{equation}\nThe equation indicates that after the collision, we will not find the center of mass position as a function of time to be lost, but we can solve for the time using the sum\n\\begin{equation}\n\\sum{m_i x_i} = (m_1 + m_2)V_{\\text{CM}}t - \\mathrm{const} = 0. \\tag{9}\n\\end{equation}\n\nEvaluating equation (9) at time $t = t_f$ and combining it with equation (1) we find for the final answer\n\\begin{equation}\nX_{\\text{CM}} = \\frac{m_1 x_{1f} + m_2 x_{2f}}{m_1 + m_2}. \\tag{10}\n\\end{equation}\n\nNote that we have used the mass sums in the idea of forces between the systems. It is not known that there was no external force on the two particles and that they eventually collided.",
    "4. Drag force at low speeds\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item We start by applying Newton's second law to the ball in the $\\hat{i}$ direction.

Throwing a ball in the wind}\n\nWe start by choosing a coordinate system with the $x$ axis pointing to the east and the $y$ direction pointing upwards. The ball has an initial speed $v_0$, so the initial motion would be in the plane defined by the $x$ and $y$ axes. However, due to the force $\\vec{F}$ of the wind if it is constant and in the $x$ direction, the motion has to be reconsidered. The work done by the wind over a path of displacement $\\vec{A}$ is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta W = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{A} = F d \\cos \\theta \n\\]\n\nwhere $d$ is the displacement vector. Thus, $\\vec{F} = (F,0)$ and $\\vec{A} = (x,y)$. From the definition of the dot product, only the $x$ direction of the displacement contributes, so integrating over the trajectory gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta W = \\int \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\int_0^t (F,0) \\cdot (v_x dt, v_y dt) = \\int_0^t F v_x dt = F \\int_0^t v_x dt = F D\n\\]\n\nwhere $D$ is the total distance traversed by the ball. \n\n\\section*{2. Work-kinetic energy theorem and Newton's 2nd law: Tetherball}\n\nWe are going to analyze here a clock for which kinetic energy changes. To calculate the net work done, use the work-kinetic energy theorem. First, we apply the law of conservation of energy. We get an idea of what forces apply, so we first need to identify the reaction of the circular motion --- We can add that this exercise only focuses on calculating the change in kinetic energy and not in potential energy, since potential energy usually does not change along this type of path (in a horizontal circular motion).\n\nIn order to calculate the net work, however we have to know the tension force and the trajectory of tetherball. The tension is not constant in this particular case; therefore, we must recall the 2nd law of Newton. \n\n\\[\n\\int F \\cdot dx = \\Delta K = \\frac{1}{2} m (v_f^2 - v_i^2)\n\\]\n\nIn the radial and tangential directions respectively.

At what time does the explosion occur?}\nThe vertical position of a fragment coincides at time zero with the origin of the cannon, a vertical axis I as well as the axis 0. A ballistic equation system describes the motion of the fragments of the projectile, that is assumed to give its motion under a gravitational field and without any air friction. The vertical coordinates $y$ follows by\n\\[\ny(t) = \\frac{1}{2} g t^{2}\n\\]\nThe vertical position obeys\n\\[\ny'(t) = v_0\n\\]\nrespectively, where $v_0$ is the vertical velocity at the initial stage ($t = 0$) and $y(t) = 0$. The peak of the trajectory is thus found at time $t_0$ satisfying\n\\[\ny(t_0) = 0 \\implies t_0 = \\frac{v_0}{g}  \\text{.}\n\\]\n(3)\nAt that time, the explosion occurs. \n\n\\subsection*{2. At which point does the explosion occur?}\nFrom equation 3, we can see that the vertical position of the projectile at the time of the explosion $t_0$ can be found to be:\n\\[\ny(t_0) = \\frac{v_0^2}{2g}.\n\\]\n(4)\n\nAt this time, the projectile will dissociate into two fragments, which reach maximum height points $B$ and $C$. This height reaches its maximum value $H$ after the explosion:\n\n\\[\nH = \\frac{v_0^2}{2g} + \\frac{V_0^2 \\sin^{2} (\\theta)}{2g}.\n\\]\n(5)\n\nHence the vertical velocity of each fragment can be found averaging symmetric positions. From this, one can find $x_{\\mathrm{com}}$ at the time of the maximum height such that \n\\[\nx_{\\mathrm{com}} = \\frac{v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t + v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t_0}{2} = \\frac{v_0}{2g} \\cos(\\theta).\n\\]\n(6)\n\n\\[\nx_{\\mathrm{com}} = v_0 \\left[ \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t_0 + \\cos (\\theta) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{v_0}{2g} + \\frac{V_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{2g} \\right) \\right]. \n\\]\n(7)",
    "Substituting equations (3) and (4) gives\n\n\\[\nt_{AB} = \\frac{v_0 \\sin \\theta}{g} \\left( 1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2 g h}{v_0^2 \\sin^2 \\theta}} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(7)\n\nThis is a sensible result as the fragments all have zero vertical velocity just before and just after the explosion. Thus, it will take them the same amount of time to fall to the ground as it did for them to ascend. Thus, we\u2019ll expect $t_{AC} = t_{BC}$ where the time of free-fall equation (5) was used.\n\nWhy do they all hit the ground at the same time?\n\nJust before the explosion, the projectile has purely horizontal velocity (since it is at the peak of its trajectory). As a result of the explosion, the fragments have no vertical velocity relative to the projectile before the explosion. Hence, just after the explosion, the fragments have the same vertical velocity that they had before the explosion. Thus, they should take the same time to fall the same height and all hit the ground at the same time.\n\n2. The pieces land on the ground in a circle. Why?\n\nGiven that we know the time at which the fragments hit the ground, in this part of the problem we will consider how the fragments travel in the horizontal direction just after the explosion. Let\u2019s denote the velocity after the explosion for the projectile as $v_{0,PC}$. If we say the explosion occurred at coordinates (xc,yc) then the fragments, in the frame moving east, will be modeled locally according to the time and velocity in the x- and y-directions. Let\u2019s look at the horizontal direction first. The acceleration in the x-direction for the general frame will be $a_x$. The horizontal coordinates for each fragment will be given as $x_i'$ where $x_i$ are the coordinates in the rest frame.\n\n\\[\nx_i' = x_c + v_0 (\\cos \\theta)  t_{AC}\n\\]\n\nfor any time $t > t_0$. Here we used the fact that all the horizontal position of every piece (i.e. with no subscript) is the same just after the explosion. Along the x-axis, the motion is entirely the same. The y-component of the motion is similarly analyzed. The general acceleration in the y-direction is given by $a_y$. The initial position of the piece fragments is $y_i'$ , and again we can use the coordinates aligned with the center of mass. (We make $y_c = h$.) The speed before the explosion was likewise given in the y-direction as $v_{0,PA}',y_i' = y_c$. To determine how fast a piece travels by a time t we directly integrate both sides of the velocity equation to get\n\n\\[\n- v_0 \\sin \\theta + t t\n\\]\n\nwhere $u_i' (x)$ and $u_i' (x)$ are the horizontal velocity and the height at the highest in the ground reference frame just after the explosion. Suppose the projectile displacement at the explosion was centered around P(cos\u03b8), let $v_{0,PC}$ be the projectile in this new frame which the fragments travel at speeds relative to the projectile. Each fragment will have no acceleration in the projectile\u2019s frame of reference for components (x,y,z) which define the vectors of the circle the pieces form with radius $v_0 \\cos\u03b8$ and similarly for the y-direction. The equation of motion for each piece returns\n\n\\[\nt_{i'} = \\frac{t_{v_0 \\cos\u03b8 + v_{0,PC}}}{\\cos \u03b8}\n\\]\n\nThis yields a circle of radius $v_{0,PA}' $.\n\n\\[\nr(t) = x + \\sqrt{v_{0,PA}' + t_{v_0}} - \\cos \u03b8)\n\\]\n\n(12)",

So, $T(x_0)$ then forms a circle of radius\n\n\\[\nR(t) = v_x t\n\\]\n\nThe first term on the right side of equation (12) tells us how this motion changes when we convert to the center of mass reference frame. Spacial the inspiratory motion of the center of mass reference frame itself when compared to $F$. Specifically, the last statement tells us that $x_0$ is at rest with respect to $\\Sigma$. So, $T\\Sigma$ corresponds to a uniform motion for $t$,\n\n\\[\n\\vec{R}(t) = \\vec{W}_{f\\text{xfo}} (t-t_0).\n\\]\n\nHowever, since all the pieces are torn apart together, it doesn\u2019t change their shape from being circular with time in the reference (sense of the ground the pieces form a circle that shifts in the x-direction with $v_{x_0}$), Let the distances between the center of the circle and the canister with $\\Sigma P_0$. When $t=t_0$, the radius of the circle is defined by equation (14) so that when the fragments hit the ground it will be using equation (14):\n\n\\[\n\\vec{E}(t_f) = v_{x} t_0.\n\\]\n\nThis is the exact location that the projectile would have hit had it not exploded. Calculate the speed and thus the radius of the circle.\n\n2.

Travel on surface/loop}\n\nThis problem may seem complicated at first (all those parameters!), but the work-kinetic energy theorem makes it relatively easy to solve. The work-kinetic energy theorem tells us that the work done by the forces on the object is equal to the change in kinetic energy. Since the object is initially at rest at height $h_1$, we know that its initial kinetic energy is zero. We'll take the final state to be when the object is at height $h_2$ and is momentarily at rest. So the kinetic energy in the final state is also zero. In going from the initial state to the final state, the total work done on the object during its motion must be equal to zero.\n\nIf we look at the forces involved, we see that this is just the sliding block problem again. The path must be divided into two parts. \n\nThe first part is discrete in order to let the object slide in the horizontal direction. The kinetic friction is used to calculate the work. We can write the work along the two parts:\n\n1. Using the form of the spring force, we can calculate the work done by the spring to be \n\\begin{equation}\nW_{\\text{spring}} = \\int_{x_i}^{x_f} k x \\, dx = \\frac{1}{2} k (x_i^2 - x_f^2)\n\\end{equation}\n\n2.

The work done by the normal force in the surface of the loop is zero. Now we just need to apply the work-kinetic energy theorem in these parts of the problem. The object is momentarily at rest at $A$ and thus is perpendicular to the trajectory. The desire of point of the force does not play on the movement.

Consider the system, composed of the wheel and the block (i.e., the two objects in the problem that move and have mass). Since we are asked about the size of the energy at a particular point in time, we are asked about the system that involves a distance, $x$, and need to consider conservation of energy. The motion of the system has a translational part and a rotational part. Let's start by looking for an equation for the wheel. Let's apply $F = ma$ in the horizontal from the table. The $-T - f - N$ equation. \n\\[\nF_{\\text{fr}} = -\\frac{dT}{dx} \\cdot T\n\\]\nAdditionally, we can find that there must be a static fiction force by $f = \\frac{1}{2} m g$.\n\na, with respect to the normal force $N$. This suggests there is some relationship between force $f$, N and the coefficient of static friction, $T$.\nThe equal requires that the frictional force $T=f* N$ where the symbol $f$ stands for the coefficient of static friction $\\mu$ and this agree with our mandate to set conservatively find $T$. This rules any non-conservative simulations, $N$ as forces that opponents their own.\n\n2. Now look at the simple model system, a block pulls a string. The rope moves energy to different parts, using energy gain from one end transferred to the other end. The tension $T$ part along with the block slightly ahead seeks energy $T x$ to the rope finally applied $T$. In this case, again had two forms of energy that is an essential property in this case. A translation separate explanation has the static friction from the above, if $T$ say from using conservative force $I (dT/dx)$, which a translating wheel obeys.\n\nIn this experiment, we started by verifying the term energy loss to say $E_a$. Since there are some extra energy effects, in this case, simplified model now that phase over. This approach verified our wheel pulled to the table and find rpm $T_a$ = torque, $N=A$ compute, since slope cancels check our result difference via new work same with the center mass. Thus mechanical energy is conserved throughout the motion of the system.\n\n\n\\end{document}",

Due to the symmetry of the system, the free body diagram for all of the wheels is identical and is thus shown above for the back wheel. Each wheel may exert a linear drag force of mass $m\\times g$, e.g., the center of the wheel is at rest (non sliding). As for the axle of the cart, the normal force from the ground, and the static friction force from the ground.\n\n2. To approach this problem, it is best to first think that which objects are not purely moving from the given ones. They include all the four wheels separately and the axles separately. The cart body moves as an object. The translational center of mass of the whole object moves with $a$, the acceleration, since each of these masses (all the donkey, axles and wheels of the object) must have balanced inertial forces.\n\nHere is the acceleration of the cart and as in the centers of the wheel's.

The first important observation is that there is a collision between the acrobat and the clown. This leads us to consider the system just at the instance before the collision and just after it. The collision is the only impulse (an \"ideal kick\") acting on our system. This impulse is internal and we will consider the forces of impulse due to it. \n\nThe time right at that instance can be defined to be infinitesimal, thus we can solve a collision problem, treat it as such, and in a larger system just append the solutions.\n\nThere are two steps that can be suitably delineated here. State 1 is immediately before the collision, as shown in figure; and state 2 is after the collision, when the acrobat leaves the platform of the clown, as illustrated in the same figure:\n\\[\n\\Delta y_1, \\Delta y_2, h_Ary, d_x, k(x)\n\\]\nwhere \\( y = y_1 - y_2 \\) are the vertical positions of acrobat and clown respectively.

This free fall happens until they collide in mid-air, not during their collision. Collisions are when they also form a triplet system.\n\nBecause the collision has to be impulsed between the external gravitational force during the collision (lastly: gravity), and it's the same if acrobat as system acted by this kick, we consider assuming our system's impulse. Just for this state, the difference value of vertical displacement \\( \\Delta h \\) just before collides thus this free-fall time be t.

First, we integrate equation (6) to find\n\n\\[\nv(t) = gt + c_1\n\\] (8)\n\nwhich fortunately can allow us to find c_1 from the initial conditions\n\n\\[\nv(0) = v_i \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v(t) = gt + v_i\n\\] (9)\n\nThus\n\n\\[\nf = m(v_1-v_2) \\quad = \\quad mg\n\\] (10)\n\nThis is the differential equation we obtained earlier in equation (6).\n\n7.

Applying this result we can use this fact to write equation (10) and find that\n\n\\[\ng = \\dfrac{T_{chain}}{2mg_2} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{2(0)}{1}}\n\\] (11) \n\n3. Falling chains\n\nThis problem is challenging. We start by taking a coordinate system with $z$ pointing downward in the direction of motion and let the origin correspond to the point from which the end of the chain slips off. The other end of the chain falls to support. Next, we take a reference point at a distance $l(t)$ above the end of length $l_0$. Thus, we will consider the differential element $\\Delta l$ that satisfies the above model.",

You next push with a force, so that in some hour the general shaft is translated up the chain to the differential element's new position in time. In other words, during translation, the mass of the chain to the left and beyond the differential element has a stationary inertial reference frame. Thus, given any coordinate system at rest in that frame so that the chain starts out at, the position and velocity of the differential element follows\n\\begin{equation}\nx(t) = v_0 t\n\\end{equation}\nrespectively. Using equation (1), we can calculate the time $t$ just before the differential element of interest makes contact with the pinion at $x(t) = L$\n\\begin{equation}\nt = \\frac{L}{v_0}\n\\end{equation}\nSubstituting this into equation (2), we see that the element is traveling with a velocity of\n\\begin{equation}\nv(t) = v_0 \\left( \\frac{L}{v_0} \\right) = \\sqrt{3 g L}\n\\end{equation}\njust before it impacts the scale.\n\nNow consider a time $\\Delta t$, after the differential elements is on the left side.

These forces reinforce each other because of the action on the rest of the chain, and would result in acceleration in one end. The only way to reduce this down to a fraction of the total force is by considering the normal force applied to the axle of the at the support point (application of the constraint of circular motion).

The instantaneous speed of the rocket is $ v $, such that there is instantaneous linear momentum in the inertial laboratory frame of $ M_0 v $. In order to accelerate the rocket, thrust is generated through the expulsion of fuel at an average rate $\\dot{M}$. Thus, let $\\Delta t$ be a short time interval during which $\\Delta M = \\dot{M} \\Delta t$ mass of fuel is expelled. Note that $\\Delta M$ is chosen to be negative as mass is lost via the exhaust. To simplify things further still, we shall also assume that fuel is ejected with a constant exhuast velocity $u$ throughout, which we shall choose to assign negative values in the rocket's reference frame. This will describe the speed at which fuel is ejected in the direction $-x$, or equivalently opposite to the fact that the rocket moves in $+x$. For convenience, we shall derive expressions for relatively small values of the time step $\\Delta t$, and from this will take $\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0$.\n\nTo proceed, we now label $M$ as the mass of the rocket and leftover fuel. Given that $\\Delta t$ is a short interval of time, let $M$ be a time-dependent variable that varies as a function of the rocket.

    "\\textbf{PHYS-101(a) \\hfill Rigid body rotation and static equilibrium : Solutions to Problem Set 11}\n\nFinally, to find the externally applied torque $\\vec{\\tau}$, we must solve equation (4). We will choose the pivot point to be the axis of rotation of the cylinder. Then the torque $\\vec{\\tau}_a$ due to $\\vec{F}_a$ has zero lever $r$ because the force is acting along the axis of the cylinder with $\\vec{r}_a = 0$, so $\\vec{\\tau}_a = 0$. The torque due to $\\vec{F}_b$ has a lever $\\vec{r}_b = R\\hat{i}_x$, because $F_b$ acts at $P$. $\\vec{\\tau}_b = \\vec{r}_B \\times \\vec{F}_b$. But the acceleration of the frictional force is purely tangential, since $\\vec{a}_B = g \\hat{i}_z$. So $\\vec{F}_b = m \\vec{a} = m g \\hat{i}_y$. The net torque about pivot $\\vec{P}$ is therefore directed along the rotation axis (upwards), as expected.\n\nIn fact, we could always solve the static torque in a rotated frame $a \\rightarrow 0$. Thus, starting with independent solutions across the cylinder (rotation) gives a simple overall sum. We assume here the force will have frictionless shear forces acting in the cylinder. Hence we may write:\n\n\\[ \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (\\vec{I}_a \\cdot \\vec{\\omega}_a  = 0)_i + r_a k_i F_b_i + k_i F_b_i = m_j (\\vec{\\omega}_j - r_j p_{i_j} ) = 0 \\quad (47) \\]\n\nwhere we use the definition of a torque for $F_a^t - k_i F_b = k_i F - F = f \\frac{dp_i}{dt} = f(\\frac{dp_i}{dt} ) = g$. To find the torque, we sum effectively the angular variables in the frame of the cone product. Substituting the form of the first result, and the second, into (34) and (19) gives:\n\n\\[ \\tau = I (R_{A_{ij}} + I_{\\text{Calcul}}) R_{ij} = Rj - g = I(\\vec{f}_j \\times \\vec{d}\\cdot \\omega f_{n_j} ). (p_{n_i} - \\vec{b}_i R_{ij}) \\]\n\nwhere we also note that the distance $r$ to the point of application of the frictional force is $r_b = 0 - R$. Equation (19) is the moment required to maintain the cylinder at a constant angular velocity.\n\n\\section*{4. Pendulum and disk}\n\n1. The total moment of inertia of a system about the axis of rotation $P$ is defined to be:\n\n\\[ I_P = \\int_R^N \\rho(x,y) (x^2 + y^2) \\, dA \\]\n\nWe let $r$ be the distance from $R$ to $P$. This integral simplifies over the entire mass of the object.

Similarly, since the disk is uniform, its centre of mass is at its geometric centre, which is a distance \\( \\ell \\) from the pivot P.

As the block is initially at rest on $h = 0$, the initial kinetic energy is $K_i = \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 = 0$. The initial potential energy is due to gravity $U_{gi} = mgh$. We will define the reference point to be at the top of the loop. Therefore, the initial total energy is the sum of kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy:\n\n\\[\nE_i = K_i + U_{gi} = 0 + mgh = mgh. \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nAt the top of the loop $y = 2R$, the kinetic energy $K_f = \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2$, and the gravitational potential energy $U_{gf} = mg(2R) = 2mgR$. Thus the total energy at the top of the loop is:\n\n\\[\nE_f = K_f + U_{gf} = \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + 2mgR. \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\nSince the track is frictionless, energy losses are nonexistent. The change in non-conservative force and mechanical energy is conserved. We can thus equate (1) and (2) to obtain:\n\n\\[\nmgh = \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + 2mgR. \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\nFrom the properties of circular motion, we know that the acceleration in the radial direction is equal to the centripetal force $\\frac{v^2}{R}$.

    "PHYS-101(a) \\hfill Potential energy, conservation of energy - Solutions to Problem Set 9\n\n\\textbf{5. Review: Tension in a massive rope}\n\nThere are several methods to solve this problem. Below we show two of them.\n\n1. In method I, we will use differential elements. To calculate the tension, we start by considering a small element of length $\\Delta y$ and let its left end be located at an arbitrary point $y$. Let $\\lambda = m/L$ be the mass per unit length. Any rope end attached to an object will try to accelerate it in the direction of the points of the object. Since the rope has a non-zero linear mass density $\\lambda$, we can calculate the net force $\\mathbf{F}$ acting on it at any point $y$. We have\n\n$$ T(y + \\Delta y) - T(y) - mg = m\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} $$ \\hspace{2mm} (1)\n\nDrawing a free body diagram for the piece of rope, we have that Newton's second law in the $+y$ direction gives\n\n$$ T(y + \\Delta y) - T(y) - \\Delta y \\lambda g = \\Delta y \\lambda a $$ \\hspace{2mm} (2)\n\nwhere $a_y$ is the acceleration of the piece of rope. Substituting equation (1) and rearranging gives\n\n$$ T(y + \\Delta y) - T(y) = \\Delta y \\lambda (a_y + g) $$ \\hspace{2mm} (3)\n\nTaking the limit that the differential element is infinitesimally small $\\Delta y \\rightarrow 0$ produces the differential equation\n\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dy} = \\lambda(a_y + g) $$ \\hspace{2mm} (4)\n\nImportantly, since the rope does not accelerate, $a_y = 0$. But the entire rope can move together. This implies that $a_x = 0$ also. The reason why the entire rope is not accelerating is that an object of mass $M$ is attached at its end. Plugging $a_y = 0$ into equation (4) gives. This can be directly integrated to produce the solution\n\n$$ T(y) = \\lambda gy $$  \\hspace{2mm} (5)\n\n2. The second method relies on the use of a boundary condition. We can either use $T(L) = 0$ if the rope is hanging freely at one end or $T(0) = F_0$ if it is attached to an object that pulls with a force $F_0$. We start with the time-independent form of Newton's second law\n\n$$ \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = T(y) / M $$ \\hspace{2mm} (6)\n\nfrom equation (1). The second is intuitive. We draw a free body diagram for the block and note the net forces acting on the system are the tensile force $T_i$ and gravity,\n\n$$ T_i = F_0 + m g - T_1 + T_1 $$  \\hspace{2mm} (7)\n\nwhere $F_0$ is the force of the rope at the right end. Finally, if no mass is placed at the end of the rope, then it is straightforward to see that $F_0 = 0$. Transforming variables $T_i \\rightarrow T_f$ to telescope elements and integrating over $y$ gives\n\n$$ T_f = -mg (y / L) - T_i $$ \\hspace{2mm} (8)\n\nsince the block has no acceleration in the vertical direction. Thus, the kinetic friction force is given by\n\n$$ f_k = \\mu T_i $$ \\hspace{2mm} (9)\n\n\\newpage",

Additionally, we know that the force of the rope on the block is identical to the reaction force of the block on the rope (i.e. $T(b) = F_\\text{block}$).

Painter on a platform}\n\nWe will explain two different, equally valid approaches to this question.\n\nThe first method is to draw two separated free body diagrams: one for the painter and one for the platform (see the sketch below). Since the ropes are tied between them and therefore the tensions throughout are equal, they can be treated as one object for the purpose of applying Newton\u2019s second law. Here, we will designate $F$ as the applied external force pulling upward on the painter. One way to make this force large and to equal the resultant force of the platform weight plus the system is to pull hard enough. Since we are interested in the acceleration $a$, first we write the equations of motion for the painter, the painter and ropes as one, as by Newton\u2019s third law the internal torque cancels out. Let $f_{1}$ denote the tension force applied by the painter and $f_2$ the tension applied by the rope to the platform. In the first approach, we denote the tension applied to the painter and ropes as $f_1$ and $f_2$.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{separation}\n\\end{center}\n\nLet $a_s$ denote the magnitude of the acceleration of the painter and $a_p$ the denote the magnitude of the acceleration of the painter. Since the painter is attached to the rope, they both have the same acceleration upwards, $a$.\n\nWe'll show below that the magnitude is the same.\n\n\\textbf{Are we clear about the common accelerations in the system?}\n\nApplying Newton\u2019s second law to the painter in the vertical direction:\n\\[ \nF - f_1 = m_{p} a_{s} \n\\tag{2} \n\\]\n\nwhile applying Newton\u2019s second law to the platform in the vertical direction gives:\n\\[ \nf_1 - m_{g2}g = m_{g2} a_p \n\\tag{3} \n\\]\n\nBy adding equations (2) and (3), we can eliminate the normal force entirely and find:\n\\[ \nF - m_{g2} g = (m_{g1}+m_{g2}) a \n\\tag{4} \n\\]\n\n\\textbf{Exercise content ends here.}\nHere's where additional details and specific problem applications would continue.",
    "Solving for the acceleration gives the final answer:\n\n\\[ F - f_1 = m_1 a \\implies \\frac{F - f_1}{m_1} = a = \\frac{190 - 19}{35} \\approx 4.9 \\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}^2} \\]\n\nA second method to find the same solution is to treat the painter and platform as a single system as we know the tension will be constant. In this case, the forces applied to the system will be: the force applied (without label), $F$, the force against that the painter and platform work (without label) and the weight gravitational force. The gravitational force will pull a combined mass that are internal to the system $(m_1 + m_p)$.\n\nApplying Newton\u2019s second law for the combined painter-platform system in the vertical direction gives\n\n\\[ F - (m_1 + m_p)g = (m_1 + m_p)a \\]\n\nThis can be solved for the acceleration, yielding the same result as given in equation (5).\n\n\\section*{2.

In other words, let us represent this before forces on each block horizontally.

This is the constraint condition. More specifically, analyzing the geometry of the system (one large block, is in contact with three other blocks). So let\u2019s look at $r_{i}(t)$, the vector for the coordinates of any block, where i is the index of the block from 1 to 4. Recall, it was previously said that $r_{ij}(t)=r_{i}(t)\u2212r_{j}(t)$ is the vector between any two blocks. These blocks are rigid bodies which don\u2019t move relative to each other in the local rest system. The choice of index to assign coordinates squares is all the blocks move at the same speed against time. We define $r$ to be the average displacement $r=\\frac{r_{1} + r_{2} + r_{3} + r_{4}}{4}$. Note that all blocks will have the same displacement as a function of time such as $r_{ij}(t)$. We can relate all of the blocks\u2019 coordinates by the average displacement as: $r_{i}(t)=r+R_{i}(t)$ where $R_{i}(t)$ is the relative displacement of all the block\u2019s centers.

If the arc acceleration is constant, the result will be a constant acceleration around the curve. Otherwise, the expression gives an arc-length-dependent acceleration, describing how the motion evolves along the curve.\nNote that for a general circular motion, we can define a fixed cylindrical coordinate system $r$ with the following properties: the $r$ axis points radially out, the $v$ axis points tangentially along the direction of motion, and the $w$ axis points vertically. The benefit is that $\\gamma$ will be zero, which we can make immediately. This allows us to understand the behavior when objects rotate along circular paths.

    "\\section*{5. Homework: Angular speed of coins}\n\n1. We choose to use a tilted/twisted coordinate system (because of the circular motion). For this part of the problem, it is not required to analyze the rotating by considering forces that cause a change of angular momentum, $\\tau = \\dot{L}$, but we look only at the fact that the system has no translational velocity with respect to this tilted/twisted coordinate system. We assume friction for the two coin tips (one below the other) on both sides as equal (the simplest case). This gives a balance of all forces with respect to this tilted/twisted coordinate system. Below right and left parts of the static friction between the coins (both between the same 2 coins) acts on. Assume that the plane of the tilted/twisted system has been chosen by tilting/twisting around the $X'_i$ axis. Hence the top coin is denoted by the left subscript, the bottom coin by a $i_b$, and the turntable by $\\tau$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\textwidth]{n}\n    \\caption{Top coin and bottom coin on turntable}\n\\end{figure}\n\nTo determine the magnitude of the radial force exerted by the turntable on the bottom coin $\\vec{f}_{r\\tau i_b}$, we resolve $\\vec{f}_{r\\tau i_b}$ into the static friction forces $\\vec{f}_{\\tau i_b}$ and $\\vec{f}^{'}_{\\tau i_b}$ in different directions with respect to the tilted plane and add them vectorially.

The tortoise and the hare\n\nTo help visualize this problem, we can start by drawing the situation, which we show in figure 1(a). Here x is the position of the hare, v is the position of the hare, and t is the total time elapsed to the finish line.\n\nThe problem states that:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item (i) The time at which the hare reaches the ledge, which is when he starts to accelerate, and\n    \\item (ii) The time at which the hare reaches the finish line.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe tortoise reaches the finish line at the same time that the hare does. The easiest way to solve this problem is by initially imagining that the hare does not reach a greater top speed than the tortoise - this is the case for the general solutions involving acceleration. In this non-accelerating situation, we can see that the hare must cross the finish line at time $t = t_2 = 0.10$ $\\mathrm{s}$, which is in taking 10 years to get there. As shown in figure 1(b), we can see that the hare's position as a function of time, $x_{\\mathrm{h}}$, is again a linear function given by the expression\n\n$$\nx_{\\mathrm{h}} = v_0 t\n$$\n\nwhere $v_0 \\approx 1$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$. The tortoise will follow a similar linear trajectory. Now, having found $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{h}} = 0.40$ $\\mathrm{s}$ we must only find the total correction factor $f$ to add to the finishing time $t_f$ as well as the point from which it will need to be added (since the hare must accelerate from this point in order to reach the finish line). To find $t$, we note that as $x = x_0 + v_0t$ when the tortoise reaches the hare ledge at position $x = x_{\\ell} =\n2 \\mathrm{m}$ it takes the hare a time $t_{\\ell}$, \n\n$$\nt_f = \\frac{v_0x_{\\ell}}{0.50 \\times a}\n$$\n\nThis gives $t_f = 1.6$ which is what we were looking for. The answer then is the trajectory of the tortoise which is shown at the top in figure 1(b).",

The train\n\n\\noindent\nThe motion of the train can be broken into three time intervals:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item acceleration (for a duration of $a_0$),\n\\item constant speed (for a duration of $t_{244}$), and\n\\item deceleration (for a duration of $120$ s).\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\noindent\nGiven the information in the problem, we can directly calculate the acceleration in each time interval to be:\n\n\\[\na_0 = \\frac{100 \\times 10^3 m}{1hr} = \\frac{1km}{1min} = \\frac{10^3m}{60sec} = \\frac{1}{v_0} km/hr\n\\]\nwhere the velocity refers first to the first, second, and third time intervals respectively. In figure ii, we use these values to plot the acceleration as a function of time.",

We will denote the velocity throughout each of the time intervals by \\(v_i\\) , where the label \\(i\\) designates one of the time intervals, i.e. \\(i\\) = 1, 2, 3, etc. Taking into account Fig. 4, we observe that the velocity is initially equal to 20 m/s at \\(t\\) = 0, and from that instant onwards, the acceleration is constant, as we can analytically gain from the solutions to problem 3. Equation (5) becomes:\n\n\\[\nv(t) = \\int a(t) dt = \\int 1 dt\n\\tag{6}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(v\\) is the acceleration during the first interval we have calculated above.\n\nNevertheless, in the form of equation (5) requires that we must integrate with respect to time interval and to then explicitly solve for the different magnitudes as far as the exponents are concerned. The work shown in problem 3 is not directly valid. Therefore, from our solution for the 1st interval \\(t = 0 \\, \\text{to} \\, t_1\\), we will denote the time interval as \\(t_i\\). Now, we must see how to calculate the remaining intervals.\n\nSince the train initially starts at a resting state let us first integrate:\n\n\\[\nv(t) = 0 + \\int a(t) dt \n\\]\n\nTherefore, at the interface between time intervals 1 and 2, the train is traveling at \\(v(t) = 0 \\) to \\( v(t) = -3 (t) \\). Substituting the initial velocity and \\(a(t) = 1\\) , equation (6) can yield, as they are that the velocity during the second interval in time becomes then:\n\n\\[\nv_2 = v_1 + \\int a(t) dt = 0 + \\int 1 \\, dt \n\\]\n\nThus, the initial condition for the third time interval is now:\n\n\\[\nv_3 = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{d}{dt} vt \\right)\n\\]\n\nTo replace the plot below we need to evaluate the three time periods. However, we must remember to translate the labels to an equivalent form according to the distribution encountered in the previously created equation. So that the velocity at the end of the three periods will have positive values:\n\nLastly, we need to relate the position analogously to the velocity, using equation (1) instead of equation (6). We have that the equations thus begin to look somewhat quantitatively as a function of time as:\n\n\\[\nx(t) = \\int v(t) dt = \\frac{1}{2}at^2 + x_0\n\\tag{7}\n\\]\n\n7",

Again, we are defining a separate time coordinate for each time interval such that the start of every time interval is at $t = 0$. We will later add them up to obtain the total location and time of the train at the start of the first time interval. The values used above for $\\Delta t$ indicate that the first time interval ($t_1$) is 7 s in duration:\n\n\\[\nx_1 = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\cdot (14) \\cdot (7)^2 = 343 \\: \\text{m}.\n\\]\n\nAt the interface between time intervals 1 and 2, the train is located at $x_2(0) = 343 \\: \\text{m} = x_1$.

Challenge: Rugby up-and-under play}\n\nAs indicated in the title, this problem is challenging. We start by defining the coordinate system such that the $y$-direction is in vertical direction and $x$ is in the horizontal. Ignoring the effects of air drag, we have the standard equations for the ball motion in the vertical direction:\nThe vertical motion is described by the height of the ball $y(t)$and is subject only to the gravitational acceleration $g$. We think we know all the players on the field, we know air is also not required for projectile motion, and write y-component of the force equations as:\n$$\nm \\ddot{y} = F_y \\Rightarrow y(t) = h_0 + V_0 t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\n$$\n\nNow the equations of motion in the horizontal direction is in the form of $x(t)$:\n$$\n(i) \\quad \\ddot{x} = 0 \\Rightarrow x(t) = (v_x)_{max} t_0\n$$\n\n1. We want to find the distance at which the player catches the ball. To do this, we first solve for the time $t_0$. The time to the highest point is the instance when the first term vanishes, there:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item the time to the highest point is $\\dot{y}(T) = 0$,\n    \\item time $t_0$ to peak height,\n\\end{itemize}\n$$\nt^{(0)} = \\frac{V_0}{g} \\Rightarrow y(t_0) = h_0 + \\frac{V_0^2}{2g} \n$$\n\n2. Now at the height's instance $t_0$, the ball is moving as\n$$\n\\dot{y}(2t_0) = V_0 - g t_0 = -V_0\n$$\nThe equations has two solutions, $t_0$ and $2t_0$ as:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} ( \\frac{v(t)}{2}) \\Rightarrow t_f = \\frac{1}{g\"} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} v_0 (\\frac{F_2}{F_1} ) \\right] \\approx 2h \\quad \\text{thus,}\n$$\n\nThe first matches to correspond to the top of the arc, and the second solved corresponds to the catch.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item We know the the horizontal displacement when the ball lands back to the horizontal motion, \\Rightarrow\n\\end{itemize}\n$$\nt = (2 V_0) / g = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n\nWe need only calculate the player's motion.

To do so, we can recognize that we want to increase the initial velocity of the ball as much as possible!\n\nThis is also intuitively obvious. The harder we kick the ball, the faster it will go and the farther it will land. Nevertheless, this could form the basis for an empirical exercise. By varying the angle $ \\theta_i $  and measuring the resulting distances traveled, we could use this relationship to deduce the initial speed (assuming we are in a flat field and dealling with only quadratic air resistance...come to think of it, this could make a fun freshman physics project!) Note also that we implicitly assumed that we are dealing with only quadratic air resistance in deriving (\\ref{range})! To maximize the speed, we can take the derivative of (\\ref{uv}) with respect to u, solve to get u(t), and then plug our result back into (\\ref{range}). Mathematically, we can take the optimal $\\vec{v}$ as: \n\\[ \\frac{d}{u} \\left[\\sqrt(\\dirac ^\\mu)^\\alpha \\right] + \\vec{v} = (\\beta_i dp) + y \\left( u \\tan(rot) \\right) = 0\n\\tag{18}\n\\]\nusing the chain rule and product rule.

Thus, this is the optimal speed such that the player would finally catch the ball. The next point to consider is maximal speed. While a player placed as close as possible to the ball at an initially maximal speed might reach it fastest (21), (24), there are two explicitly distinguishable instances where the player is either behind or ahead of the ball at $t = 0$. Therefore, we have to explicitly distinguish these two possible ways of solving:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nv_{\\rm max} = v_{\\rm min} + \\sqrt{g x_{\\rm f}} .\n\\end{equation}\n\nCombining equations (17), (18), and (21), we find that the maximum distance to catch the ball is\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta x = v_{\\rm player} t_{\\rm f} .\n\\end{equation}\n\nCombining equations (1), (18), (25), (19), we find that steps B to kick the ball is\n\n\\begin{equation}\nx_{\\rm across} = x_{\\rm player} t_{\\rm across} + \\frac{g t_{\\rm across}^2}{2} - \\left( \\frac{t_{\\rm across} v_{\\rm player} - x_{\\rm initial}}{\\sin{M}} \\right)^2 + \\delta t.\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe interpretation of the situation is that there are two analytically valid approaches if sufficiently large hill is not immediately in front of the ball at launch time: for the ball placed to the right while the height decreases concentrates around the $y$ axis. The second case corresponds to the ball entirely off the east side of the hill. As long as the speed is selected such that the initial placement is handled correctly, this situation can be improved to first, considering the nearest neighbor next-preferential before the other. In order to fully track the ball while maximizing the distance travelled by the ball, the ball needs to be pushed for as long as possible until close to a river crossing or an even greater hill. Then the ball is pushed with a large marginal area for an even return of to optimal.\n\n\\noindent 7. The optimal ball value is given by equation (9).

All the labels become classes : \n\nLevel of confidentiality \n\nTopsecret, Secret, Confidential and White, which are defined in an access control matrix.\n\nDominance relationship\n\nA security level $L1$ dominates $L2$ and only if $L1$ is bigger than $L2$ AND $1$ is a subset of 2.\n\nThe star label (*) indicates in columns the topmost label is biggest set. In a dominance lattice, the access matrix will then be :\n\nClearance levels\n\nClearance : Minimum security level a subject has been assigned (Normal Security Level: subjects are competent but trustworthy)\n\nNo-property (*) : \n\nNo write to objects in lower levels\n\nNo Read ($IRB$) levels\n\nNo-write is: \n\n$ no~write~ (high~levels~only~for~urgent) $\n\nNo read (\\textbf{Bell La Padula})\n\n \nNo Exams (Jobs, files) to allow to have an authorization into a higher level temporarily; to be done on request.

It is a hacker process of the Bell IN property.\n\nDiscretionary property (ds property)\nIf an access takes place it has to be in the access control matrix.\nInformation should be accessed on a need to know basis,'' DAC (Least privilege inside the security model).\n\nBe careful!\nAs we allow more access to information, mainly simply knowing that de it is in a certain security level and that it is there, we need to track it to identify leakS and pubS information following this model.\n3.4.3 Covert channel\nThe more resources are shared: the harder it is to make sure there is no information flow. Ke info is kept in temporary memory, i.e. laptop already used temporary files in clipboard. Sometimes there are filtering firewalls that are configured in order to allow only a dedicated hardware per virtual machine to avoid leaks between different virtual machines (start up CPU et threads). But it is good to recheck before information leakS.\n\nThe need for classification\nAn user wants to share information, but he has to be identified if they are not secret cleared and to know about restricted information: e.g. a database, a license. Example: Microsoft word includes a feature that can let you know the clearance of information shared.\ninfoLAB can provide watermarking for paper and images' to actually trace collaboration inside the model and notify the user of very important information.\n\n3.4.4 CONCLUSION\nIt is good to classify data not only for its integrity, availability, It's no low level and no! to block hackers from collating data, Integrity is mainly important to actually consume information and take action or work with the process.\n\n3.5 MAC: Integrity Models\nBell La PaduLa focuses on confidentiality. B is good for military services). But we also need to look at integrity. We are looking to be sure that the data haS not been modified. There are goals in integrity, veracity, and consistency. We must ensure authorized actions only: authorized users will make authorized actions' and preserve it from non-hack attacks/no modification, Integrity means accuracy and that infoLab database is conceptually different from confidentiality.\n\n3.5.1 The BIBA model for integrity\nWe only have three types, read and write.",
    "Two key rules that are very strict\n\nSimple integrity: No read down, protects higher integrity principals from being corrupted by lower integrity data.\nStar integrity: No write up, prevents lower integrity principals from corrupting high integrity data.\nFor this model, a user establishes a need and every employee needs. Employees can\u2019t rewrite rules.\n\nBIBA variant 1: low watermark\nThe Low-Water Mark Policy is a dynamic policy with write down that harshly reduces an integrity label of an entity if a lower integrity data or process interacts with the subject and then writes it out again. Not widely adopted due to the need for many exceptions.\n\nBIBA variant 2: low watermark for objects\nWhen an object is modified by a low integrity, the high integrity subjects can\u2019t read it anymore. Better suited for integrity model.\n\nBIBA Additional rule: invoke\nSimple invocation: Only allow subjects to invoke subjects with a label they dominate. This protects the high integrity data from being sent to an entity with a lower integrity data.\nCombined model: Users at top can write, read up and down. Users with limited permissions can write up and read down. Flaw of specific pathology inheritance.\n\n3.6 Multi-Property security models\n\nCombining security properties\nBLP helps confidentiality but no integrity, BIBA integrity but not confidentiality and the Chinese Wall model.\n\nWho executes the TCB?\nUsers add their personal libraries and software/ cryptographic.

Simple: blocks ... pad your message if it is shorter and mask your message as it is running through the scrambler as stream into packets.\n\nInitialization vector (IV) - if encrypted in parallel or integrated.

And THEN, we delete R from the server so this block can't be reused by an attacker.\n\n\\subsubsection{How to have a secure storage?}\nOf course, that's easier to be clear. We have several options.\n\n\\textbf{Hashing the Message:}\nSome hashed messages - that have to leave the property of one - (per image missions), are not directly stored (hash passwords). We hash user's passwords either before in the external files or we can find files on the server-side. But properly using these hashes can cost the user a lot more storage and can be easily broken. A better idea is basically hashing the data on the system, like in the case of e-mail verifications (SEND an electronic time-sent) after registered in the server database, we can then securely see if the user is a legal owner of these unique verifications codes match, then create the home signed/image and add a checksum (over all time process stored in the selected folder).\n\n\\textbf{Hashing and Salting the message:}\nIn this process, we give the user a chaotic, leaderboard area (not need to be seen, it's just to easily map the user's personal data with these added inputs. The primary line is known, the salt's are very large and random generated random (an entire list). Some servers do not like using this feature to avoid the extra cost in hardware\u00a0 migrations.\n\nSome better known techniques need a lot more traditional technology on how we call/process some authenticated identifiers, starting with ldentifi cation and strong certified keys applications. Most servers fail these alternative techniques redundancy, strong as a list of restriction policy setter codes that fails users to only see identifier logs (most cases for banking and large corporations). As the unique approaches, we see that sufficient attacks are harder to be explained.\n\n\\subsubsection{Secure checking}\n\\textbf{Checking Letter by Letter:}\nThe idea behind how every standard block has information about the password (the logger it raises medium) generated into the custom and random values per letter from 1024 big iteration blocks secured, a flexible pre-signed technique. For the user's blocks we need every possible smaller numeric value example (additionally possible) separated. This will be stored as verify alternatives inside smaller slots - through hash logic. An idea behind typically how to preevaluate is little block-like checksum figure inputs for every signed input (binary code/certified signature). This approach works because every key carried around will be correctly hashed.\n\n\\textbf{Different complex authentications:}\nThose signatures will help a user to manually re-proof text to write; unless wondered or mean time missing verifications. Furthermore, they can get strikes (descriptive: shoulder surfing, phishing, social engineering, etc....).\n\n\\subsection{Authentication : Biometrics}\nBiometrics is the measurement and statistical analysis of people\u2019s unique physical characteristics.\n\nAdvantages : nothing to remember, guess, difficult to delegate (can\u2019t share).

The goal of the firewall is to filter, limit access (impose access control), and protect the internal network and its resources from floods and attacks (Simple and Stateful). Usually, this limit access through and to the Public Network, make out-going connections safer. We can also filter the user environment by blocking inappropriate sites.

One can also drop other incoming address addresses.\n\n\\paragraph{Stateful Firewalls 1990s:}\nCan inspect all packets, on the state however they understand TCP/UDP semantic. This enables the filtering based on TCP/HTTP session and connection.\n\ni) Filter the connection (HTTP client opens a connection to the server), and the server the server sends response request allowed depending on the state of the connection.\nii) Close the connection after completion of transmission.\niii) Application Gateway: (HTTP/FTP) - restart the connection itself, and allow/deny based on the application command e.g. an HTTP request to access some sites\ne.g. FTP to site blocks the URL.\n\nThis also provides filtering based on the URL for instance enforced company rules blocking by the firewall e.g. bad sports betting sites, pairing some management sites.\n\n\\paragraph{Commercial trends}\ni) Anti-spam filters on the inside of the HTTP traffic to send jump to users have substantial blocking of user machines not only flooding but also using their server for sending spam.\nii) HTTP, XML ...

    "Chapter 10\n\nMalware\n\nIntroductions\n\nIn previous attacks, the adversary activity exploits users/ design/ implementation errors. They require the adversary to analyze the protocols and procedure for code that exploits the vulnerability. These are rare but high-impact attacks.

    "10.2 Malware: Taxonomy\n\nThere are different kinds of malware. The main different are how they spread ans whether they are self-contained:\n- \\textit{Viruses:} Viruses spread by themselves. Viruses tend to need some human action that triggers the spread, while worms act on their own.\n- \\textit{Trojan and spyware:} are not able to auto-reproduce their spread and only locate in one place. \n- \\textit{Worms:} Programs that can reproduce by themselves.\n\nThe other main distinction factor is if something had to infect another program:\n- \\textit{Infecting:} by modifying files from the different categories to increase their impact.\n\n10.3 Virus\n\nIt\u2019s a piece of software that infects other programs to perform malicious actions such as monitor operations, obtain passwords, send data, etc. When a file infected with a virus is opened or executed, first, the virus code that has been inserted at the beginning (or end) of the data must be executed and it will propagate. Once complete the original program begins. Usually, a virus will modify some values, like inserting some bits or sequences into useful communications in order to trigger it.\n\n\\textit{Payload:} It is the action which characterizes the behavior of the malware. The payload varies for different types of malware. Could be a different functional virus each time code A infects a new program or attendee. Usually the first combination action is the file that acts as the human target.\n\nA virus can infect a machine through user devices like contaminated email attachments, malformed codes into a handheld held both officially linked to that machine.\n\n\\textbf{Where can they act?}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textit{File infection:} Overwrite, parasitic (append modifies)\n    \\item \\textit{Boot sector:} It modifies the system boot program\n    \\item \\textit{Macro virus:} Attack macro language files (example: visual basic (MS Excel, word))\n    \\item \\textit{Mutant or polymorphic:} Even produce a distinct virus appearance per generation\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\textbf{Some have below defenses that tend to change tokens within the other pornus key memory addresses.}\n\n\\textbf{Defenses}\n\nAny infliction to give program least privileges.\n\n\\textbf{Antivirus Software}\n- \\textit{Signature-based:} activities tries to find exact signature in the last. Signature are pieces of known malware binary which the antivirus program needs to store (in big quantity) in the local host to periodically scan against newer files.\n- \\textit{Heuristic-based:} Analyse the full program for what is known to be produced by viruses ex: access to the registry, systematic changes to function borders. \\textit{Some false positive}.\n\n\\pagebreak",

Self replicated computer program that uses a network to send copies of itself to other hosts. To do this, worms utilize vulnerabilities of target machine/ user such as letting a USB auto-run to copy themselves.\n\nThe main feature of a worm is self-propagation and autonomous spreading. Once a host is infected by a worm, it will scan the network and propagate itself over its active interface(s). \n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item e.g.\n    \\item Propagation by exploiting \\texttt{buffer overflow} in Microsoft \\texttt{SQL} server services.\n    \\item Click Trojan (2011). \n\\end{itemize}\nEncrypt data and ask for ransom in Bitcoins/cash as a motivation.\n\n\\textbf{BH /Tim}\n\nWorms usually send their copies to all the hosts of the worm over the nonroot/zero bus have no different than altruism to the worms and no virus at all. \n\nWorms slow down the entire network. It is difficult to contain the worm in controlled conditions. E.g. exploited a vulnerability in a NSA backdoor toolkit leak.\n\n\\section*{Defences}\n\n\\subsection*{Host level}\n\nWorms infect machines by exploiting vulnerabilities in hosts. Protection from remote exploitation requires running the latest defensive software and not allowing other hosts the possibility of introducing malicious code. \n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Activity monitoring, anomalous host behaviour: look for hosts representing too many/too few bytes.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection*{Network level}\n\nThe main difficulty in the case damage by worms is to limit their capability to spread.

And THEN, we delete R from the server so this block can't be reused by an attacker.\n\n\\subsubsection{How to have a secure storage?}\nOf course, that's easier to be clear. We have several options.\n\n\\textbf{Hashing the Message:}\nSome hashed messages - that have to leave the property of one - (per image missions), are not directly stored (hash passwords). We hash user's passwords either before in the external files or we can find files on the server-side. But properly using these hashes can cost the user a lot more storage and can be easily broken. A better idea is basically hashing the data on the system, like in the case of e-mail verifications (SEND an electronic time-sent) after registered in the server database, we can then securely see if the user is a legal owner of these unique verifications codes match, then create the home signed/image and add a checksum (over all time process stored in the selected folder).\n\n\\textbf{Hashing and Salting the message:}\nIn this process, we give the user a chaotic, leaderboard area (not need to be seen, it's just to easily map the user's personal data with these added inputs. The primary line is known, the salt's are very large and random generated random (an entire list). Some servers do not like using this feature to avoid the extra cost in hardware\u00a0 migrations.\n\nSome better known techniques need a lot more traditional technology on how we call/process some authenticated identifiers, starting with ldentifi cation and strong certified keys applications. Most servers fail these alternative techniques redundancy, strong as a list of restriction policy setter codes that fails users to only see identifier logs (most cases for banking and large corporations). As the unique approaches, we see that sufficient attacks are harder to be explained.\n\n\\subsubsection{Secure checking}\n\\textbf{Checking Letter by Letter:}\nThe idea behind how every standard block has information about the password (the logger it raises medium) generated into the custom and random values per letter from 1024 big iteration blocks secured, a flexible pre-signed technique. For the user's blocks we need every possible smaller numeric value example (additionally possible) separated. This will be stored as verify alternatives inside smaller slots - through hash logic. An idea behind typically how to preevaluate is little block-like checksum figure inputs for every signed input (binary code/certified signature). This approach works because every key carried around will be correctly hashed.\n\n\\textbf{Different complex authentications:}\nThose signatures will help a user to manually re-proof text to write; unless wondered or mean time missing verifications. Furthermore, they can get strikes (descriptive: shoulder surfing, phishing, social engineering, etc....).\n\n\\subsection{Authentication : Biometrics}\nBiometrics is the measurement and statistical analysis of people\u2019s unique physical characteristics.\n\nAdvantages : nothing to remember, guess, difficult to delegate (can\u2019t share).

Part of the address identifies the host, and part the network.\n\n\\subsection*{8.2.1 How does IP routing work?}\n\n\\subsubsection*{Routing: routing IP on an Ethernet LAN}\n\nHow does IP routing work?\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Alice needs to communicate with Bob:\n        \\begin{itemize}\n            \\item Alice's IP address: 10.0.0.1\n            \\item Alice's MAC address: aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa\n            \\item Bob's IP address: 10.0.0.2\n            \\item Bob's MAC address: bb:bb:bb:bb:bb:bb\n        \\end{itemize}\n    \\item Bob's IP address is on the same subnet\n    \\item Send packet directly to Bob:\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{image}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Try one of two different subnets:\n    \\item Option A: Ask For MAC address\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{image}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Otherwise, send to 10.0.0.3 --> Router forwards \n\\end{itemize}\n\nInside the LAN, hosts communicate over a network - they don't include Bob's MAC address.\n\n\\subsubsection*{How can Alice learn about Bob's MAC?}\n\nARP is a translation between IPv4 addresses and MAC addresses. Each host maintains a cached table: (Alice can query Bob's MAC belonging to the machine and can completely ignore the IP). An ARP request is broadcast: the message is of the form `what is the MAC address for IP x.y.z.w?\u2019. ARP reply is sent in response to requested Machine with MAC address, for example requesting the IP address.\n\n\\subsection*{8.2.2 ARP Spoofing (only for local networks)}\n\nWhat can you observe?\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item If an attacker controls ARP, (router/revrouter) with my MAC address/another\n        \\begin{itemize}\n            \\item Disclose information\n            \\item Manipalate information\n            \\item Obtain access to network\n        \\end{itemize}\n    \\item Denial Of Service: cause that packets arrive on one host.\n\\end{itemize}",

(Domain Name System)}\n\nWe need three levels to resolve requests that outdo the authoritative name servers. There are non-registered and registered domains. The IP can be calculated in two ways:\n\n\\textbf{Cache poisoning}\nCache then provides values (job $\\&$ pass) pairs. This involves client-side stored Name extension points and looking for the IP of a specific domain.\n\nPawn hijacking\nThis is the substitution task for DNS answers. You can directly hijack the pairs to corrupt the request, thus allowing for theft of personal information.\n\n\\subsubsection{8.3.2 DNS spoofing : Defenses}\n\n \\textbf{Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)} \n \\begin{itemize}\n   \\item Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are digitally signed for authoritative data hosts.

We are making sure that the adversary does not target our link but DNS only goes to the destination address, we have to guarantee there is no module break and leak-test proximity links are not given.\n\nEffective actions with BPG will be listed (with some test). It concerns the routing table between the autonomous state against the guy injecting poison.\n\nHere is an analogy (cf. cf. cf.

    "- No multiplexing : no way to associate messages to a network address to specific applications/users on hosts\n\n8.6  TCP : a transport protocol\n\nThe previous operations were at the networking level. Since we are at transport level, it is now \"end-to-end\". The protocol used at this level is the TCP protocol for Transmission Control Protocol. Thus, we have TCP header for Src Port, Destinatio Port, Seq No, Ack No, window ; the first two allow multiplexing. The rest guarantees reliability and congestion control and the last one ensures flow control.\n\n8.6.1 TCP 3-way handshake\n\n\\begin{center}\n  \\begin{tabular}{ c c }\n    Client time line & Server time line \\\\ \\hline \n    Connect Y &  \\\\\n      & Listen (Port X) \\\\\n     & $\\uparrow$ \\\\\n    SYN Sent & $\\uparrow$ \\\\\n    $\\downarrow$ \\quad Port X | Port Y & \\quad $\\uparrow$ SYN Rec. \\\\\n    {\\tt seq = i, wdo} &  Port X \\\\\n    $\\downarrow$ & \\quad Port X | \\\\\n    Established & (Port ->)($i+1$, data) \\\\\n    &  {\\tt SYN + ACK, wdo} \\\\\n    {\\tt ack = i+1} & $\\uparrow$ Established \\\\\n    (Port ->)($i+1$, data) & \\\\\n  \\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\nIt is easy to mix up the connect and listen with the actual sequence generated by the three way handshake (but remember that an ACK is only important AFTER the three way handshake if you remember the functioning of the protocol.)\n\nData transfer is possible starting at time $(i+1)$ on both sides.\n\nThis usually goes inspectic, and data can flow without limits\n\nAfter the window, the following segment can be sent again until a certain number of retries is reached.\n\n8.6.2 Basic stage of TCP Hijacking\n\n1.

    "\\subsection*{8.7.1 TCP SYN flood}\nThe adversary exploits the fact that after receiving a SYN and sending a SYN/ACK, the server\nstays waiting for the client to complete the third part of the handshake with an ACK. No attack\nhas been performed: these are not broken TCP stacks, but they have an intentional and desired\nside channel. An interruption would allow the space for TCP. In the best cases upon low connections anyone\ncan remember the SYN-synched request.\n\n\\subsection*{8.7.2 TCP SYN prevention}\nReduce the amount of states kept by the server until the handshake is done (no uncommon TCP).\nInstead the server allocates very small state that enables how big spaces are being if suspicious node\nstops handshaking.\n\n\\subsubsection*{DoS prevention cookies}\nThe idea is to allocate the TCB but wait to be clear. The client has to provide cookies but\nthis is not the cookie itself. THESE ARE NOT THE COOKIES OF INTERNET. So it sends some\nauthenticators when they receives SYN and ACK by the client. No states are generated for several\nsockets. Once the server gets back the cookie he checks that.

    "\\subsection{Other protections:}\n\n\\subsubsection{NAT : Network Address Translation}\nRouter that translates source Address of the form \\{Internal IP, Port\\} $\\rightarrow$ \\{External IP, Port\\}. This limits the number of public IP addresses and implies that an external entity won\u2019t reach the internal host (as an already mapped port (hide does not stop all attacks but limits attack hard)).\n\n\\subsubsection{Network Firewalls}\nA firewall is a network router, that connects and internal network to an external public network. The goal of the firewall is to filter, limit access (impose access control), and protect the internal network and its resources from floods and attacks (Simple and Stateful). Usually, this limit access through and to the Public Network, make out-going connections safer. We can also filter the user environment by blocking inappropriate sites. We can also enforce company rules and restrictions.\n\n\\paragraph{Firewall access control}\nInspect characteristics of the traffic, ``allow'' or ``deny'' traversal across the firewall and generate the rules needed for reference to current activity policies (in text-based).\n\n\\paragraph{Simple packet filter 1990s:}\nInspect each packet in isolation and reject/allow depending on certain rules (output, not equal, in-bound, equal). (e.g. drop UDP, permit HTTP request). Therefore service is granted based on connection. Filtering Header level e.g. Dropping packet from a big port to a listening server. One can also drop other incoming address addresses.\n\n\\paragraph{Stateful Firewalls 1990s:}\nCan inspect all packets, on the state however they understand TCP/UDP semantic. This enables the filtering based on TCP/HTTP session and connection.\n\ni) Filter the connection (HTTP client opens a connection to the server), and the server the server sends response request allowed depending on the state of the connection.\nii) Close the connection after completion of transmission.\niii) Application Gateway: (HTTP/FTP) - restart the connection itself, and allow/deny based on the application command e.g. an HTTP request to access some sites\ne.g. FTP to site blocks the URL.\n\nThis also provides filtering based on the URL for instance enforced company rules blocking by the firewall e.g. bad sports betting sites, pairing some management sites.\n\n\\paragraph{Commercial trends}\ni) Anti-spam filters on the inside of the HTTP traffic to send jump to users have substantial blocking of user machines not only flooding but also using their server for sending spam.\nii) HTTP, XML ... Gateway - e.g secure connection dropped by inspecting headers on the firewalls of the session e.g. block P2P addresses accessing many hosts on high ports.\niii) Backups and IDS intrusion detection systems detect WR, monitoring traffic to detect kinds of security documents, scanning downloaded materials for viruses.",

Viruses tend to need some human action that triggers the spread, while worms act on their own.\n- \\textit{Trojan and spyware:} are not able to auto-reproduce their spread and only locate in one place. \n- \\textit{Worms:} Programs that can reproduce by themselves.\n\nThe other main distinction factor is if something had to infect another program:\n- \\textit{Infecting:} by modifying files from the different categories to increase their impact.\n\n10.3 Virus\n\nIt\u2019s a piece of software that infects other programs to perform malicious actions such as monitor operations, obtain passwords, send data, etc. When a file infected with a virus is opened or executed, first, the virus code that has been inserted at the beginning (or end) of the data must be executed and it will propagate. Once complete the original program begins. Usually, a virus will modify some values, like inserting some bits or sequences into useful communications in order to trigger it.\n\n\\textit{Payload:} It is the action which characterizes the behavior of the malware. The payload varies for different types of malware. Could be a different functional virus each time code A infects a new program or attendee. Usually the first combination action is the file that acts as the human target.\n\nA virus can infect a machine through user devices like contaminated email attachments, malformed codes into a handheld held both officially linked to that machine.\n\n\\textbf{Where can they act?}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textit{File infection:} Overwrite, parasitic (append modifies)\n    \\item \\textit{Boot sector:} It modifies the system boot program\n    \\item \\textit{Macro virus:} Attack macro language files (example: visual basic (MS Excel, word))\n    \\item \\textit{Mutant or polymorphic:} Even produce a distinct virus appearance per generation\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\textbf{Some have below defenses that tend to change tokens within the other pornus key memory addresses.}\n\n\\textbf{Defenses}\n\nAny infliction to give program least privileges.\n\n\\textbf{Antivirus Software}\n- \\textit{Signature-based:} activities tries to find exact signature in the last. Signature are pieces of known malware binary which the antivirus program needs to store (in big quantity) in the local host to periodically scan against newer files.\n- \\textit{Heuristic-based:} Analyse the full program for what is known to be produced by viruses ex: access to the registry, systematic changes to function borders. \\textit{Some false positive}.\n\n\\pagebreak",
    "\\textbf{Sandboxing}\n\nRun untrusted applications with least privileges/ restricted environment.\n\n\\section*{10.4 Worm}\n\nIt's a standalone piece of software that can generate malicious actions. Self replicated computer program that uses a network to send copies of itself to other hosts. To do this, worms utilize vulnerabilities of target machine/ user such as letting a USB auto-run to copy themselves.\n\nThe main feature of a worm is self-propagation and autonomous spreading. Once a host is infected by a worm, it will scan the network and propagate itself over its active interface(s). \n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item e.g.\n    \\item Propagation by exploiting \\texttt{buffer overflow} in Microsoft \\texttt{SQL} server services.\n    \\item Click Trojan (2011). \n\\end{itemize}\nEncrypt data and ask for ransom in Bitcoins/cash as a motivation.\n\n\\textbf{BH /Tim}\n\nWorms usually send their copies to all the hosts of the worm over the nonroot/zero bus have no different than altruism to the worms and no virus at all. \n\nWorms slow down the entire network. It is difficult to contain the worm in controlled conditions. E.g. exploited a vulnerability in a NSA backdoor toolkit leak.\n\n\\section*{Defences}\n\n\\subsection*{Host level}\n\nWorms infect machines by exploiting vulnerabilities in hosts. Protection from remote exploitation requires running the latest defensive software and not allowing other hosts the possibility of introducing malicious code. \n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Activity monitoring, anomalous host behaviour: look for hosts representing too many/too few bytes.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection*{Network level}\n\nThe main difficulty in the case damage by worms is to limit their capability to spread. This can in principle be done at the network level:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Monitoring suspicious connections from a host e.g. vertical signatures/ pattern detection for worm signatures (sending too many TCP SYNs to collect other addresses).\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section*{Instruction Detection Systems (IDS)}\n\nA set of technology solutions to monitor the activities and network traffic malicious activity. IDSs can run in a host (local host based IDSs) in the network lines (e.g. look at all the traffic relevant to the user) or both.\n\nRegional standard. Monitor network patterns (too false alarms but require human insights to make data signatures, can\u2019t hold weird worms).\n\n\\newpage",
    "\\textit{Anomaly base} : attempts to identify behavior different than legitimate (adapt to new attacks but high number of false alarms). \n\n\\section{Trojan Horse}\nA trojan horse is a piece of software that appears to perform a desirable function (deceiving the valid user, known to the performer of the attack). In fact, it has a sinister role in performing another function (injurious to the background). They create an OS on their own for the victim's host to restart the program that contains the trojan.\n\n\\paragraph{Defense}\nIt is antivirus programs that test privileges and train the user to not run programs that come from untrusted sources.\n\n\\paragraph{Ex:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Elsie Baker's rboot, compares Unix Mode of Operation / u;\n    \\item The first operation to boot does a reset and loads a keylogger.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\paragraph{Signs that the system is under an attack:}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item SSL / Bank website shows that your bank website does not support before encryption (TLS...*);\n    \\item System captures / logs keystrokes;\n    \\item Programs that are run after a reboot;\n    \\item All network interface of the ports are set to listen when it makes a banking website;\n    \\item Quick injection to run as pop-up / an alert sensor to malware server.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\section{Rootkit}\nIt's the malicious code that the adversary has managed to install in the core of the OS and then inside the IO forensics most often as an update to the firmware of every interfaced device. It is added to the IO to find hidden images, check and analyze function calls when high-level calls are made for intermediate operations. Rootkits are able to maintain access to Cd anatomical physiology and hard disks when the legitimate user tries to get access to sometimes eg. photo files. Rootkits are therefore the most evasive to detection. Only a well trained specialist can figure it out.\n\n\\section{Backdoor}\nIt is code (or functionality) that allows the adversary to bypass secure authentication layers/path that are not authenticated by the policy, opens connections to applications without authorization.\n\n\\section{How to find whether a program has a backdoor, trojan, rootkit?}\nBy code inspection, to inspect the source code but even if it is a clean, a backdoor can be introduced during the deployment. By analyzing the binary software that transforms high level code into low level code that can be understood by the machine.",
