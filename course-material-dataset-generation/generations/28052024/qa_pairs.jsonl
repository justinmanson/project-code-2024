It contains no application-layer data and includes a randomly chosen initial sequence number. "}
{"question": "How does a TCP client initiate the disconnection process?", "chosen": "To close a TCP connection, the client deallocates the source states for the transport connection, issues a close command to TCP, sends a $FIN$ bit segment to the server, and finally issues an acknowledgment $ACK$ segment to the server after receiving the server's shutdown $FIN$ bit segment. "}
{"question": "What is TCP hijacking and how does it work?", "chosen": "TCP hijacking is a type of attack where a hijacker impersonates one of the parties in a communication to provide fake content.

{"question": "What is a SYN flood attack in the context of computer networking?", "chosen": "In a SYN flood attack, the attacker sends a large number of TCP SYN segments without completing the third handshake step. This causes the server's connection resources to become exhausted, leading to false connection requests overwhelming the server and potentially preventing it from accepting legitimate connection requests. "}
{"question": "What are some defenses against SYN flood attacks?", "chosen": "Defenses against SYN flood attacks include limiting the duration that a client has to be authenticated during the 3-way handshake, selectively authenticating clients, limiting the number of half-open connections from a single IP address, and implementing SYN cookies. SYN cookies encode the server's initial sequence number with information about half-open connections, allowing the server to defer resource allocation until after the receipt of the ACK segment. "}
{"question": "How do SYN cookies help in mitigating SYN flood attacks?", "chosen": "SYN cookies help mitigate SYN flood attacks by encoding the server's initial sequence number with information about half-open connections. This stateless way of handling connection requests makes the server less vulnerable to SYN flooding, as it does not store unnecessary information for connections. By using SYN cookies, the server defers resource allocation until after the receipt of the ACK segment, ensuring that resources are allocated only for legitimate connections."}
{"question": "What are the two main approaches to congestion control in networking?", "chosen": "The two main approaches to congestion control in networking are either having the network layer handle it by signaling congestion to end-hosts, or having the transport layer handle it by having end-hosts signal congestion to each other.

{"question": "What is the purpose of the congestion window in TCP?", "chosen": "The congestion window in TCP, denoted as $cwnd$, imposes a constraint on the rate at which a TCP sender can send traffic into the network, helping to control congestion and regulate the sending rate. "}
{"question": "How does TCP use acknowledgments to adjust its congestion window size?", "chosen": "TCP uses acknowledgments to trigger an increase in its congestion window size, with every ACK received leading to an increase in the window, while loss events cause the sender to adjust its congestion window size based on this information."}
{"question": "How does TCP sender determine the rate at which it should send?", "chosen": "TCP sender determines its rate based on principles such as decreasing rate when a segment is lost (implying congestion) and increasing rate when an ACK is received for an unacknowledged segment. "}
{"question": "What is the purpose of bandwidth probing in TCP?", "chosen": "Bandwidth probing in TCP involves increasing transmission rate in response to arriving ACKs until a loss event occurs, at which point the transmission rate is decreased. "}
{"question": "What is the slow-start state in TCP congestion control?", "chosen": "In the slow-start state, the window size in TCP begins at 1 MSS and doubles in size for every RTT until it reaches the threshold value called ssthresh, at which point TCP enters congestion avoidance mode."}

{"question": "Why is it important for end-systems physically close to one another to have similar IP addresses?", "chosen": "It is important for end-systems physically close to one another to have similar IP addresses because IP addresses depend on the end location information, and having similar IPs for physically close systems helps in maintaining homogeneous and \"full\" ranges in forwarding tables. "}
{"question": "How does a router determine the correct output link for a packet based on the destination IP address?", "chosen": "When a router receives a packet with a destination IP address, it looks in its forwarding table and performs the longest match to the destination IP to determine the correct output link for forwarding the packet."}

{"question": "Describe the TLS handshake process between a client and a server.", "chosen": "The TLS handshake process involves the client and server agreeing on cryptographic algorithms and establishing session keys. It includes steps such as ClientHello, ServerHello, exchanging certificates, and agreeing on an ephemeral key for key agreement using Diffie Hellman. "}
{"question": "What is the goal of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack and what are two common methods used in DoS attacks?", "chosen": "The goal of a Denial of Service attack is to prevent systems or networks from accessing a service by overwhelming it with excessive traffic. Two common methods used in DoS attacks are flooding a host with so many packets that it cannot respond, and using multiple hosts to send packets to a server through IP spoofing to bombard victim hosts with replies (smurfing). "}
{"question": "How can DoS attacks be prevented, according to the lecture notes?", "chosen": "According to the lecture notes, DoS attacks can be prevented by filtering based on original addresses or by separating packets with different addresses through TCP (TCP Syn flooding)."}
{"question": "What is a TCP SYN flood attack?", "chosen": "A TCP SYN flood attack is when an adversary exploits the fact that the server waits for a response (the third ACK) from the client after receiving a SYN and sending a SYN/ACK. By not sending the third ACK or delaying it, the adversary can keep many half open connections on the server, leading to resource exhaustion. "}
{"question": "How can TCP SYN prevention be achieved?", "chosen": "TCP SYN prevention can be achieved by reducing the amount of state kept by the server until the handshake is completed. This involves storing a very small state that enables the server to manage the reduction in resources effectively. "}
{"question": "What is the goal of DoS prevention cookies in TCP?", "chosen": "The goal of DoS prevention cookies in TCP is to prevent DoS attacks by requiring the client to provide cookies back to the server to initiate a connection. These cookies help the server verify the legitimacy of the client and prevent resource exhaustion due to malicious requests. "}
{"question": "How does a Snuff attack work in the context of TCP/IP?", "chosen": "In a Snuff attack, the adversary sends 'reset' packets to connections to close them and avoid any further communication. This attack aims to disrupt legitimate communication by flooding the victim with reset packets, leading to network congestion and potential denial of service."}
{"question": "What is NAT in the context of network protections?", "chosen": "NAT stands for Network Address Translation and refers to a router that maintains contact tables to map internal IP addresses and ports to external IP addresses and ports. This prevents external entities from accessing the NAT client it has already mapped, making attacks harder. "}
{"question": "How do stateful firewalls differ from simple packet filters?", "chosen": "Stateful firewalls can maintain lookup to a high port from a returning client and use deep packet inspection, whereas simple packet filters inspect each packet for source and destination address and make allow/deny decisions based on table lookup. "}
{"question": "What are some features of proxy-based firewalls?", "chosen": "Proxy-based firewalls are application-layer firewalls that check at the user level and make allow/deny decisions based on the packet's information and state. They can filter HTTP traffic to a local proxy, inspect payload for certain keywords, and apply rules based on behavioral analysis or monitoring tools. "}
{"question": "How do network firewalls help protect internal networks from external threats?", "chosen": "Network firewalls act as a barrier between an internal network and an external public network, inspecting traffic and making decisions based on policy. They can use simple packet filters or stateful firewalls to allow or deny traversal across the firewall and prevent packets that do not conform to security policy."}
{"question": "What are the downsides associated with firewalls according to the lecture notes?", "chosen": "The downsides with firewalls include slow data processing, the need for continuous monitoring to make decisions about vulnerabilities or authorization at the application layer, and the lack of adaptability or authenticity.

{"question": "How does the De-Militarized Zone (DMZ) concept split \"the world\" into different zones?", "chosen": "The DMZ concept splits \"the world\" into three zones: WAN for the outside, DMZ for public services, and LAN for internal users only. "}
{"question": "What is the role of a firewall in a De-Militarized Zone (DMZ) setup?", "chosen": "In a DMZ setup, a firewall ensures that only traffic to well-known services traverses the outer firewall, and only traffic from \"known hosts/clients\" LAN from DMZ is allowed. It also enforces, monitors, and authenticates flows between LAN, DMZ, and WAN to keep internal resources safe in case a service is compromised."}
{"question": "What is the importance of privacy for individuals, companies, and governments?", "chosen": "Privacy is important for individuals to protect online accounts, against attacks, and to control access to personal information. For companies, privacy is needed to safeguard business decisions, trade secrets, and product launches. Governments also require privacy to maintain confidentiality in investigations and negotiations. "}
{"question": "How is privacy defined and why is it considered a difficult concept to formalize?", "chosen": "Privacy is a subjective and abstract concept that varies based on culture, education, and context. It is challenging to quantify and determine who has access to information. Additionally, privacy raises ethical questions about liberty and the balance between keeping information private and ensuring a safer society. "}
{"question": "How does the knowledge of being watched affect people's behavior in terms of privacy?", "chosen": "When individuals know they are being watched, they tend to alter their behavior. This change in behavior is a result of the shared infrastructure, like the internet, and the awareness that their actions are being monitored, leading to a shift in how they interact and share information."}
{"question": "What are the concerns and goals of Social Privacy as explained in the lecture notes?", "chosen": "Social Privacy addresses concerns defined by all Users and aims to stop annoying the User by supporting decision-making and providing awareness and control over who can see their information. "}

{"question": "What are the pros and cons of end-to-end encryption?", "chosen": "The pros of end-to-end encryption include confidentiality of content and the ability to carefully handle encryption keys by the recipient. The cons include potential failures within the system, the risk of a single point of compromise in communication, and the fact that data in the clear can be accessed by the provider. "}
{"question": "How does forward secrecy help in encryption and communication security?", "chosen": "Forward secrecy addresses the problem of key theft by regularly invalidating old keys to make communications unintelligible for adversaries. This prevents the decryption of previously seen ciphertext by adversaries, making correlation in time harder."}
{"question": "What are two key properties that are typically lacking in most mixlike anonymous communication systems?", "chosen": "Limited throughput and the need for users to trust all mixes due to a single point of failure for anonymity. "}
{"question": "How does the Tor network utilize onion routing to provide anonymity for its users?", "chosen": "The Tor network allows users to choose a path through a series of nodes, where each node encrypts and forwards the message in layers, ensuring that only the final node knows the entry-exit information. "}
{"question": "What is the main feature of low latency anonymous communication systems, like the Tor network?", "chosen": "Low latency ACS, such as the Tor network, prioritize near real-time message relay without delay, even though normal message speed may be hindered due to flow."}
