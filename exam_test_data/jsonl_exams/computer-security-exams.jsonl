{"subject": "computer_security", "question": "Question: A group of psychology researchers plan to study group dynamics. They set up an experiment where volunteers need to solve a puzzle together and write their progress in a file puzzle/updates.log. Researchers hire “spies” to hide among the volunteers to cause tension in the group and disrupt their progress. To avoid being discovered, spies do the same activities as the volunteers. To keep the experiment unbiased, researchers should not communicate with volunteers nor spies. At the end of the experiment, the spies write their observations regarding group dynamics to a separate file dynamics/observations.log. These observations must be kept secret from volunteers. In the end, researchers analyse puzzle/updates.log and dynamics/observations.log to generate their report.txt that must not be shared with spies nor volunteers. Assuming that (1) for Bell-LaPadula model the ordering of classes is (TOP SECRET > SECRET > CONFIDENTIAL > UNCLASSIFIED), (2) for BIBA, the ordering is (HIGH INTEGRITY > LOW INTEGRITY), (3) “Puzzle” and “Dynamics” are categories; which of the following options is a good choice to ensure that all accesses happen according to the rules?\n\nOptions:\nA.
